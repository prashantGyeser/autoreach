This was the '70s. Going to Harvard Law School or Harvard Business School was a pretty established path. \nBut I looked back on it, and I guess there may have been some of the born elements. When I was in high school I did some jobs like mowing lawns and paving driveways in August — something no one in southern Ohio wants to do. And when I started Sam Adams, in 1984, those experiences were very important. I was basically a beer-delivery guy coming into the back of a restaurant and getting treated like crap. It didn't bother me, though. \nAnd a few years ago, I realized I've never been in a job where I have a boss. I've always had some mild problems with authority. \nBefore I started my company, I was a management consultant at Boston Consulting Group for almost seven years. I had kind of learned what I was gonna learn about business. I felt like, well, I don't want to be a management consultant for the rest of my life. \nWhy beer? \nI grew up around beer. My dad was a brewmaster. So beer has been part of my life ever since I can remember. I had my first beer at 4. \nSkye Gould/Business Insider \nYou've said that your father thought it was a terrible idea to get into the beer industry. \nYes. Because he had been a brewmaster when the beer industry was going through this terrible consolidation. When he got into brewmaster school, in 1948, there were 1,000 breweries. When I started Sam Adams, there were maybe 40. \nHe didn't think I could compete with the big brewers, with the Bud, Miller, and Coors. And it took him a while to grasp what I was doing, because it was so different. And I said, look, I am not trying to compete with those guys. I am trying to make something better. Richer, more flavorful, higher quality, and I'm gonna charge twice the money. And I think I can make a little niche out of that. \nI was making beer for 1% of the market. \nWhat role do you think Sam Adams played in the growing popularity of craft beers? \nI can't tell you it happened quickly. It really took 20-something years. When I started, even the term \"craft beer\" didn't exist. We were called micros, and it was this radical idea. \nIt was a long, slow process for the education of a consumer. I had been in thousands of bars, doing wait-staff education, where I'd come in with the ingredients in beer and show them the malt and the hops. I'd show them the hops extract and explain that this is the shortcut that a lot of imported beers use. These are real hops. This is malt. \nBeer was sold on the advertising and the marketing of a brand, not the ingredients, brewing process, and the passion of a brewer. \nOnce people start drinking Sam Adams — or, now, all the craft beers out there — you can't go back. \nNow that you've achieved your goal of creating a world where Americans appreciate beer, how do you deal with your place in a growing craft-beer market? \nTo me, this is a lot better world than when I started. Because it was lonely. And now I've got a lot of company. There's no sense trying to start a revolution if nobody wants to follow. We've always tried to be a leader, and leadership doesn't work if there's no followers. \nFor example, after Boston Lager, I started making seasonal beers. Nobody was doing this. And now that's kind of one of the mainstays of craft brewing. And in the early '90s, we became the first brewer to age beer in bourbon barrels. \nWe've had increasing competition for 25 years, with more and more people coming into craft brewing. And that just makes us better. That pushes me to continue to raise the quality level and to continue to innovate and make new beers. \nCourtesy of the Boston Beer Company Koch tasting a limited-release Utopia brew, which is barrel-aged and has four to five times the typical alcohol content of beer. \nWhat are some new things you're developing? \nThere's a whole bunch of new beers that we're working on. We're making beer that is not carbonated, but rather nitrogenated, which completely changes the flavor profile. Beer doesn't necessarily have to be carbonated. It wasn't carbonated until 150 years ago. \nWe're also exploring some very traditional flavors in beer that have disappeared, like hard root beer, which was very common in the 18th century. \nIn 2008 you started the Brewing the American dream program to mentor entrepreneurs and provide them with loans. What inspired it? \nI've long held the belief that as a business, you need to recognize your role in the greater community and acknowledge that you need to do more than just make money for your shareholders. \nAnd that's become trendy now, but I actually wrote an article in 1976 in the Harvard Environmental Law Review, and the theme was that data proved businesses that recognize a social mission do better financially than businesses that don't. Forty years ago, that was a pretty extreme idea, against the ideas of the popular economist Milton Friedman. \nFor many years, we did a lot of philanthropic things, supported charities, some of our local neighborhood organizations. There was a time in 2007 when we painted a community center in our neighborhood that needed renovation. It was one of those \"feel good\" things and everybody reacted positively to it, but I remember walking back to my car, thinking, \"You know, I don't feel that great about what we just did.\" \nWhy's that? \nWhat's exciting about being an entrepreneur is that you add value, hopefully in new ways. And what bothered me about that day is we probably spent $20,000 worth of management time to do $3,000 worth of mediocre painting. And that wasn't, at least to me, adding value. \nSo I decided to go back to the drawing board and treat our social mission with the same level of creativity and innovation that we brought to the beer business. \nAfter a year of developing an idea, we realized we were good at growing a small business and being creative and that we can bring that to up-and-coming businesses. \nI wondered, well, what would have been really useful to me when I was starting Sam Adams? What did I need that wasn't available? And the two things were access to loan money — 'cause nobody would lend me money — and second, nuts-and-bolts business advice. You know, not big, strategic philosophical stuff. \nWhen I started Sam Adams, I had an MBA from Harvard, a law degree from Harvard, six or seven years of management consulting. But guess what? I didn't know how to make a sales call. I didn't know how to design a label. I didn't know how to do a real-estate lead or set up a payroll. I didn't know how to get publicity for my business. \nSo we decided that Brewing the American dream could bring that to small businesses in the industries we know: food, beverage, hospitality. \nSkye Gould/Business Insider The Beer Association defines a craft brewery as one that produces under 6 million barrels annually, has less than 25% of company ownership in the possession of a noncraft brewer, and mainly produces traditional beers (not flavored malt beverages). \nWhat's the program like? \nIt's free, but there's a cap on participants. We ask the entrepreneurs to come with real problems, like determining how to hire a salesperson or get their product into retailers. \nAnd before arriving, they can sign up online for 20-minute sessions typically with six different coaches. We call it \"speed coaching\" because it's a bit like speed dating. \nWe discovered that 20 minutes of solid advice can take people from zero to 80% or 90% of where they need to be in a particular area. And that's plenty good. \nWe've had over 4,000 entrepreneurs go through coaching since launching in 2008. \nWe've also made about 400 loans through our nonprofit microlending partner, Accion, and the total loan amount has been about $4 million. The loan repayment rate is 98.1%, and the average collection period is two to three years. \nWe develop long-term relationships with all of the entrepreneurs we've made loans to, as well as many from the coaching sessions. \nWhat's the most common advice you give entrepreneurs? \nThe most common thing I remind people of is to only pursue something you love, because a small business is going to be very demanding of your time, your energy — it just eats your life. And if you're doing something you love, then you will accept and even enjoy that. If you're just doing it to get rich, you're gonna lose heart. \nI tell everyone, getting rich is life's biggest booby trap. It comes down to what would you rather be, happy or rich? I say do what's gonna make you happy. \nWhich books have shaped your business philosophy or worldview? \nI love to read, so there's a lot. I'll give you a couple of interesting ones. \nThe first one is by an industrial engineer named Edward Demings. It's called \" Out of the Crisis .\" Demings was the father of the quality-control movement. He was revered in Japan, and it led to Japanese firms making some of the highest-quality products in the world. \nThe book's written in a colloquial Midwest style. I learned a lot from that. \nAnd the second is by the physicist Thomas Kuhn, \" The Structure of Scientific Revolutions .\" He coined the term \"paradigm shift.\" \nThe book helped me think about removing the blinders and not think within constraints, to be able to say, \"I know this is the way the world is, but why can't it be different and better?\" \nSkye Gould/Business Insider \nWhat has the industry taught you? \nI've always approached brewing with a sense of humility and reverence. Because it's been around for 12,000 years, and no matter what you do, you're only going to add one more brick into this wall. \nSo in that spirit, I learned to fail small and often. I've had innumerable failures, and I've done 'em quick and moved on. \nIt's beer, you know. It's not like I'm trying to come out with a new iPhone. We probably make 50 batches for every beer that the consumer sees. So in that sense, for one successful beer, we have 49 failures. \nYou became a billionaire in 2013. How has that affected you? \nOh, I don't care. It is what it is. It's actually sort of funny, because as the stock goes up and down, depending on the day, I might be a billionaire or I might be an ex-billionaire. \nI think after the last earnings amount, it wiped out like $50 million worth of my value. You might think, \"Oh, that's terrible.\" No, it's not! I never in my life thought I'd have that kind of money to lose. So I think it's pretty cool. \nDoes that success become a burden when you try to approach business as the underdog? \nThat kind of thing is a purely financial metric, driven by Wall Street. And I've learned to ignore all of these short-term ups and downs of stock price. Because what I care about is the health of the company long-term. \nSo I'm worried about, where are we in two years? In five years? How do I make this the best, strongest, healthiest company I can? \nIf you become driven by what Wall Street values instead of what your drinkers value, you're making a big mistake. \nWhat does drive you? \nI remember when we went public. We sold shares to the public, via coupons, on the six-packs. The investment banks hated it, but I was determined we were going to do it. We got $65 million in the mail. \nWe sold shares to the public, at $15 per share, and to the big investment banks and institutions, for $20 per share. I remember a fund manager berating me for that, and he says: \"Wait a minute! You know, I buy lots of shares, I should be the one getting a lower price, not all these beer drinkers.\" \nAnd I said, \"Well, are you a beer drinker?\" And he said, \"No, I drink wine.\" I said: \"Well, that's my point. I don't need you. I need all those beer drinkers. So they're getting the lower price, not you.\" \nCourtesy of the Boston Beer Company", :performance_score=>4, :spam_score=>0.0}, {:url=>"http://omgili.com/r/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24meuL1ei1Bo_4Wh5TwSLsGQijwM6RQnn8y3Xj66BsgvECZQA8q56RyLPoyPKGI86m4igAFK9on7wT96YlyP0JtOZfBnVfx8lmjJ8Tiy8c02fNH", :final_url=>"http://www.businessinsider.com/samuel-adams-founder-jim-koch-on-craft-beer-revolution-2015-6", :published=>"2015-06-23T13:58:00.000+03:00", :title=>"Billionaire Sam Adams founder tells us why his father said the beer business was a terrible career choice", :text=>"print \nMike Nudelman/Business Insider Boston Beer Co. cofounder and chairman Jim Koch. \nWhen Jim Koch left a successful career at Boston Consulting Group in 1984 to start Boston Beer Co., the idea of making an impression in a beer market dominated by domestics such as Budweiser and imports including Heineken seemed outlandish. \nBut with his flagship product, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, Koch has become a prominent figure in the industry, and his company produces an estimated 1% of all beer in the US. \nBoston Beer Co. had a record 2014, bringing in $903 million in revenue and selling 4.1 million barrels of beer and cider in all 50 states and about 30 countries. \nWe spoke with Koch about his career, the evolution of the American beer industry, and how he approaches leadership and management. \nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length. \nBusiness Insider: When did you know you wanted to start your own business? \nJim Koch: I never thought of myself as an entrepreneur.

That is just one of the findings from a report published last month: Social media management: Tools, tactics ... and how to win , and highlighted in a new infographic. The report also found that small companies and big brands approach social media very differently. Among the differences, the two groups employ quite different tools when it comes to managing their social engagement. Tools used by big brands TweetDeck was responsible for delivering 16% of all tweets by top brands, followed by SocialFlow with 14%. Interestingly, 13% of the tweets in a 250-thousand-tweet sample were delivered through the Twitter.com website, and not via any SMM tool. Below is a list of the twenty most-used third-party tools by top brands, excluding proprietary applications, Twitter Ads, Twitter’s own clients (including TweetDeck and the Twitter web client). Of course, some of these tools vary substantially in capabilities. Tools used by SMBs Two out of five SMBs use no third-party tool to manage their social media accounts at all. Instead, they rely on either the Twitter Web Client to manage their presence, or they use broadcast tools such as WordPress plugins. Of the 60% that do use a SMM tool, however, there is a clear favorite… Hootsuite is used by more than twice as many of the respondents. Buffer and TweetDeck take up the second and third positions. With social posting being the number one reason to use an SMM tool, it is no surprise to see solutions that excel in this area - and allow for the scheduling of posts - rise to the top.

These were taken from a list of Twitter accounts developed by Majestic SEO, which ranked 50,000 Twitter accounts according to followers, the number of citations each has received, referring domains, external backlinks, and referring IPs. Rogers then manually edited the list to remove non-business accounts (like Lady Gaga), and cross-referenced it with company revenue data to determine the top brands to watch. Rogers then analyzed 250,966 tweets sent via 198 tools, websites, and proprietary applications via our data partner, Texifter, and its DiscoverText tool.

That is just one of the findings from a report published last month: Social media management: Tools, tactics ... and how to win , and highlighted in a new infographic. The report also found that small companies and big brands approach social media very differently. Among the differences, the two groups employ quite different tools when it comes to managing their social engagement. Tools used by big brands TweetDeck was responsible for delivering 16% of all tweets by top brands, followed by SocialFlow with 14%. Interestingly, 13% of the tweets in a 250-thousand-tweet sample were delivered through the Twitter.com website, and not via any SMM tool. Below is a list of the twenty most-used third-party tools by top brands, excluding proprietary applications, Twitter Ads, Twitter’s own clients (including TweetDeck and the Twitter web client). Of course, some of these tools vary substantially in capabilities. Tools used by SMBs Two out of five SMBs use no third-party tool to manage their social media accounts at all. Instead, they rely on either the Twitter Web Client to manage their presence, or they use broadcast tools such as WordPress plugins. Of the 60% that do use a SMM tool, however, there is a clear favorite… Hootsuite is used by more than twice as many of the respondents. Buffer and TweetDeck take up the second and third positions. With social posting being the number one reason to use an SMM tool, it is no surprise to see solutions that excel in this area - and allow for the scheduling of posts - rise to the top. The full report, with more detail on social listening, content, posting tactics, and more is available here: Social media management: Tools, tactics ... and how to win . The full infographic is below [caption id=\"attachment_1755912\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"792\"] Social media management and marketing report infographic[/caption] Note on methodology The author of the report, VB Insight's Stewart Rogers, monitored a total of 1,600 business Twitter accounts over a period of nine days to discover how they tweet. These were taken from a list of Twitter accounts developed by Majestic SEO, which ranked 50,000 Twitter accounts according to followers, the number of citations each has received, referring domains, external backlinks, and referring IPs. Rogers then manually edited the list to remove non-business accounts (like Lady Gaga), and cross-referenced it with company revenue data to determine the top brands to watch. Rogers then analyzed 250,966 tweets sent via 198 tools, websites, and proprietary applications via our data partner, Texifter, and its DiscoverText tool. To include the full metadata for each tweet, he worked with Gnip-enabled data streams.

This interactive campaign not only leads to healthier habits, but it also fosters an interactive online community of brand loyalists. #WeDareYou to snap a photo of fresh produce & tag it #FreshVeggiesWDY for your chance to #win ! http://t.co/FbxtpbU91B pic.twitter.com/5KtZyxfpzJ — Source4Women (@Source4Women) June 7, 2015 3) Anne Arundel’s Medical Center: Stachie Facebook Contest \nThis contest, organized by Anne Arundel’s Medical Center, asked participants to post their best “stachie,” – otherwise known as a selfie with either a real or fake mustache. The purpose was to raise awareness for men’s health during November (or, “Movember” or “No Shave November,” as it has popularly come to be known). \nThis clever contest not took advantage of social media hilarity, but it also drove traffic to the medical center’s webpage for Men’s Health , which has other attractions for awareness, like their blog, podcast, and calendar of events. More awesome stachie submissions! 4) Dana-Farber Brigham & Women’s Cancer Center: You Have Us \nIt’s an incredibly powerful slogan: “Right now you may have cancer. But what your cancer doesn’t know is – You Have Us.” Through confidence-inspiring web videos , the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute shows their personal approach to cancer treatment and state-of-the-art facilities. \nBy sharing these videos on social media (as well as using more traditional marketing techniques, like television and radio) the cancer center embodies what it means to build trust with your target audience. 5) Floating Hospital for Children – Tufts Medical Center: OurCircleofMoms.com \nOne of the main covenants of effective marketing is catering to your target audience – and the online community/blog OurCircleofMoms.com does exactly that. The content and community of support that Our Circle of Moms offers for mothers whose children are patients at the Floating Hospital for Children lives up to their slogan: “Just What Moms Ordered.” \nBy creating this space for mothers to find the support they need, the Floating Hospital for Children is positioning their medical center as a trusted resource for parents. 6) The Mayo Clinic: Sharing Mayo Clinic Blog \nThe Mayo Clinic sees patients from literally all around the world and the goal of the Sharing Mayo Clinic blog is to unite these diverse patients into a global online community. The blog showcases stories from patients, family members, and Mayo Clinic staff. \nThese inspiring stories and the sense of community that comes from sharing them in one place plays directly into Mayo Clinic’s well known reputation as a trusted healthcare resource. Of course, Mayo Clinic is no stranger to having multiple blogs and general healthcare marketing awesomeness , so their inclusion on this list shouldn’t come as any surprise. 7) Arkansas Children’s Hospital: #100DeadliestDays \nIn order for a hashtag-driven marketing campaign to be successful, it has to be memorable and worth sharing. \nThe shock factor of the #100DeadliestDays social media campaign from the Arkansas Children’s Hospital (in partnership with the Injury Prevention Center) aimed to raise awareness of the dangerous time period between Memorial Day and Labor Day when the risk of death for children and teens is increased. \nArkansas Children’s Hospital shared safety facts and tips on their social media channels, including popular infographics, which can be seen here . 8) Banner Health: Infographics \nSpeaking of infographics, visual content is widely popular with digital marketing audiences, as exemplified by these helpful sugar content and flu myths infographics by Banner Health. Infographics are best used to simplify a potentially complicated or controversial topic, like children’s sugar consumption. \nThey tend to resonate with audiences who may not be interested in sitting down to read a full blog post on an important topic. Plus, infographics are highly shareable across all social media channels, making them a great attention-grabber to attract new patients. \nOf course, this list is far from a complete collection of all the great healthcare digital marketing happening on blogs and social media. With so many ways to connect with patients and prospective patients online, healthcare organizations are finding more and more ways to market brilliantly every single day. \nTopics: Content Marketing Subscribe to HubSpot's Marketing Blog Join 400,000+ fellow marketers!

(Screengrab courtesy of TRAC) \nThe latest video from ISIS depicting the killing of accused spies and apostates in grisly and bizarre ways is a twisted message to the world that the terrorist army is carrying out its savagery in accordance with Islamic law, according to analysts. \nIn the seven-minute, all-Arabic language video released June 23, victims say they have been treated well, but then 15 of 16 men are shown being murdered, some blown up in a car in a drone-style attack, others by being drowned while trapped in a cage and still more lined up on their knees in the desert with explosives detonating around their necks. Experts who analyzed the video shot in Iraq’s Nineveh Province said there is a clear message underlying the carnage: ISIS wants the Muslim world to know it is imprisoning and killing enemies of Islam under its warped interpretation of the Koran. \n“While ISIS likes the shock factor, these executions are chosen to show their compliance with sharia law,\" said Ryan Mauro, national security analyst for the New York-based Clarion Project. \"ISIS is acting upon doctrines that say spies and apostates, those who leave Islam, are to be executed. \n“They must offer a triptych of executions, each more savage than the last.” \n- Veryan Khan, TRAC \n“ISIS will argue that these specific methods are justifiable according to Islam as they see it, and that they are not being barbaric just for the sake of it,\" he added. \"Even its executions are an attempt to portray ISIS as the most legitimate followers of Islam.” \nThe video begins with the captives being interviewed about how well they were treated while held by ISIS, also known as Islamic State, remarkable because the terrorist army is attempting to repair its image, Mauro said.

(Screengrab courtesy of TRAC) \n“The group includes this because it needs to be seen as humane,” Mauro said. “It's hard to believe, but it implies that ISIS recognizes it has a negative image and wants to change that while still remaining brutal.” \nThe video also shows ISIS has little popular support, and is worried about spies in their midst, Mauro added. \nVeryan Khan, editorial director for U.S.-basedTerrorism Research & Analysis Consortium, said ISIS has a template for spy executions: There must be the “confession” and the hostage must remain calm before the execution to demonstrate both Islamic State generosity in their treatment of prisoners as well as the victim’s knowledge they deserve this punishment. As with other videos, hostages are well rehearsed - likely through mock executions - and did not appear to know that this time they would be killed, Khan said.

This means that they have to up the ante in order to gain more attention for each new release,” Khan said. \n“What is shocking is the style of each execution - it is no longer enough to behead, or to behead 21 men simultaneously, to burn them alive, or shoot them in mass firing squads. They must offer a triptych of executions, each more savage than the last,” Khan said. Related Image Expand / Contract One captive was allowed to live, although it was not clear why.

The presence of the site on social networking stages ensures better rankings in web index result pages. Like each endeavor, the right approach is an essential for having an effective run. Considering the significance of the digital marketing , it is compulsory for each business to make the most of social media marketing ad campaigns using the popular platforms that target group of onlookers you plan to tap. Recognize Your Target Audience \nBeing a proprietor of the business, you are obliged to know the crowd that you are pander to. Social networking stages have a huge client base with a wide range of clients. Through your posts, you need to identify your target market that could be connected with the sort of item or administration your organization offers through the site. After you effectively distinguish them, focusing on them gets to be simpler. Carefully Select Social Media Sites \nIt is not under any condition important to be on every social webpage that exist on the web. In any case, one must have the capacity to observe the unobtrusive contrast between every one of them. There is a sure level of uniqueness about every systems administration site, and it is imperative to choose which one is most appropriate for the organization. Upgrade the Social Media Posts \nTo help the social networking stages help your site in SEO, you have to streamline the social posts for the web crawlers. To enhance them, you need to utilize the watchwords and make the substance important. Advancing the substance helps an extraordinary arrangement in SEO. \nTips: Verify your social media contents are human readable. Think quality first. On the off chance that you have a WordPress site, check your watchword proportion with Scribe. Pack your contents with valuable realities, measurements and dates. Limit the redundancy of keywords in Alt labels, title and the captions of the images. Develop Your Followers \nWhile this is less demanding said than done, the quantity of supporters you have communicating for your sake can impact your site's rankings. While developing your numbers is a long, monotonous procedure, it is more powerful than endeavoring to trick the framework by obtaining intermediary online networking devotees, as Google can recognize how certifiable your supporters are. Organic growth or Natural development is key, which should be possible by posting quality articles with important data, tips, and solid client administration and client engagements. This sort of narrating forms a dedication among clients, which will build your fans and followers. Social Sharing \nAny kind of social sharing aides validate the authority of your site. Google's calculations perceive social sharing, which is a key contributing component to the authority of your brand. Getting clients and different brands to share your substance can be troublesome. For each one who will share, there are handfuls who won't. Be that as it may, one of the best approaches to urge clients and members to share your substance is to offer specifically to them. Rather than essentially presenting a connection on an article, attempt to create something that has a motivator for individuals to make a move. Offer a review, a question and answer platform, or even a giveaway. \nTips The adherents would share the post all alone however asking them will expand the shares impressively. The supporter would share the posts anyways, however others too will go with the same pattern when convinced and poked courteously. Subsequently, it will go far in boosting the SEO for the site. External Inbound Links \nLegitimate connections to different sites from your site is still a discriminating part to SEO, social networking guides in your capacity to further make and get links. Not just would you be able to share the substance of others, luring them to respond by sharing your substance, social networking goes about as a door to create enthusiasm about your site.

Local Optimization of Social Media Posts \nThe contents on the online networking stages additionally require local improvement when the objective clients are neighborhood for the business. You must advance the posts among the neighborhood group which will go far in boosting the SEO for the site , consequently expanding the return for capital invested on the business. \nBottom Line: Social Media Marketing has a staggering achieve as it connects with billions of individuals over the world.

Comments, retweets, likes, requests, questions, emails. Notifications whooshing around at 90mph, all day. KPI’s and ROI. Everyone demanding attention, needing you to listen, to respond, to cajole, to soothe, to champion. \nTotal. Overload. \nSome days you want to break every screen in front of you, join the National Park Service and spend three months manning a fire tower in Montana. \nPeople who deal in content generation and manage relationships use more emotional and mental energy than most every day. Every interaction drains your cognitive power source - only a little, but these little losses add up. \nPicture a thin, red string running from you to each member of your community – whether it’s forum/community members or social followers. If you manage an account with 150k Twitter followers, that’s 150k tiny threads. Picture much bigger threads running to influencers, colleagues, and your company’s leadership. \nThis makes it easier to envision your impact, and also to see how you can get pulled in multiple directions at once and get tangled up in all those threads. To keep from being tripped up, each one requires a little bit of energy and attention. It’s rewarding, but tiring. \nThis is where the practice of taking breaks comes in. \nWe are inclined to believe that more time > more effort > and more speed > will make us more productive. \nWe’re wrong. \nMultiple studies ( here and here , for starters), and my own work habits, have shown that regular breaks significantly enhance productivity and creativity. \nA majority of the research on peak productivity recommends working intently for 40-50 minutes and then taking a 10-15 minute break. This technique is not only taught and encouraged at major corporations, it’s how students at MIT and other elite universities are encouraged to study. \nBreak time isn’t wasted time. \nIn order to allow your hardworking brain to function at its peak, you need to allow it a few minutes of rest every hour. Just like cooling down between exercises at the gym, your brain experiences fatigue and needs to rest. These breaks have an added benefit for social professionals - they allow you to step away from all of the strings pulling on you and re-center. By stepping away for a few moments, you’ll be more effective at creating top-notch content and managing all those relationships. \nBottom line, you get more accomplished when you take breaks (and, your dreams won’t be limited to Montana fire towers). What constitutes a break? \nAn ideal break gets you out of your chair, away from your computer. \nGo for a walk, go to the bathroom, doodle, listen to music, get outside, set a timer and breathe for a minute or two, stretch, meditate, read a few pages of a book, talk to a co-worker. \nOnce you do one of these, come back and enjoy some baby animal pics. I’m serious, and you can thank Japanese researchers for this one. They have found that college students performed better after looking at images of baby animals. Interestingly, adult animals and food didn’t have the same impact. So: baby French Bulldogs, yes. French fries, not so much. \nAnother tip: Take your vacation days, all of them. Every year. Even a long weekend away from all of those threads provides valuable rest, as people returning from extended time off have been shown to make fewer mistakes and be more productive. \nIf taking breaks is new to you, start slow. I recommend working in at least two 10-15 minute breaks a day, and going from there. Or commit to eating lunch away from your desk, every day. \nWe talk a lot about burnout for social folks. It’s an amazing, demanding job. So, think of it this way: To reach your full potential, to impact the most people, to stay healthy, schedule breaks or be ambushed by a breakdown. \nIt was my pleasure to talk about breaks and other techniques for reducing stress, increasing productivity and cultivating mindfulness earlier this month at Social Shake Up. Since the conference I’ve heard from multiple attendees who are now planning to take summer vacations. My hope today is that you commit to scheduling yours. \nWhat’s your take on breaks? Got a strategy to share? I’d love to hear from you.

We look at the benefits of publishing content on LinkedIn and Medium, and offer three bonus tips on how to produce more content with minimal time. Publishing on LinkedIn \nIf you can publish content on your LinkedIn profile, then you have a powerful way to ensure that your contacts see your latest content. To find out if you can publish content to your LinkedIn profile, log in and look for this on your Home page. \nIf you don’t have it yet, you will likely have to wait until it’s rolled out to your account. Alternatively, you could contact support to see if they can enable your account for publishing. \nClick on the option to publish a post. LinkedIn offers more detail about long-form posts on its publishing platform. \nThere are two main benefits of publishing content directly on LinkedIn: Your first-degree connections are notified. Your post can be featured on LinkedIn’s Pulse channels in a relevant category. \nLet’s talk first about first-degree connections. \nNew post notifications are opt-out only for the time being, so your first-degree connections will receive notification through the LinkedIn website or app when you publish your first post. \nYou need to make your first LinkedIn post great. Offering great content is a must, and the headline is extremely important, as it will either encourage people to click to read your post or to turn off notifications about your future posts. \nThe key to making your content valuable is knowing who your connections are or knowing which ones you want to reach. For example, if your customers are CEOs in the marketing industry, then make sure you create posts with that profile in mind. \nOn the other hand, if you just want to make sure your content gets the most exposure possible, you will want to cater to the major commonalities among your first-degree connections. Start by going directly to LinkedIn’s people search . \nIn the sidebar, use search filters to see where the majority of your contacts are located and in what industries they belong. \nLinkedIn Premium members can see the groups to which their first-degree connections belong, job functions, and seniority levels. \nAll of these can help you determine what kind of content to create to appeal to the majority of your first-degree connections. You can’t cater to everyone, but you can make sure that the majority of your first-degree connections like your first and subsequent posts. \nThe second benefit is that your content can be featured in LinkedIn’s Pulse, which is a digest of top posts – typically by category – as selected by LinkedIn. The categories include entrepreneurship & small business, marketing & advertising, productivity, leadership & management, recruiting & hiring, careers, and big ideas & innovation. \nTo access Pulse from your profile, go to Interests and then click Pulse. \nYou’ll see the collection of featured posts as well as their categorization. \nTo get selected as a featured post in a category, choose a topic that fits squarely into a category, provide great educational content, select an appealing picture, and add relevant tags to the bottom of your post. Selection of featured posts by LinkedIn can happen quickly (sometimes within minutes of publishing, from my experience). \nSee the tags and the featured designation at the bottom of this post, below. \nTo select topics, it can be helpful to see what type of content does well on LinkedIn as a whole. You can run this search on BuzzSumo to find out. Medium \nMedium is a blogging platform that uses minimalist design to focus on high-quality content. It’s free to use – you just sign in with your Twitter or Facebook account when you have blog content to publish. You even get a free statistics dashboard to see the impact of your posts, referred to as stories. \nUnlike your own blogging platform, Medium recommends other stories published on the site. Therefore, your stories have the chance to get a lot more exposure than if you publish it on your own website. \nOne great benefit of publishing content on Medium is viral social sharing. The top post published on LinkedIn within the last year had 100,000 shares. The top stories on Medium have more than 300,000 shares. \nAside from the potential of going viral, you also can grow an audience of followers on Medium that are interested in your content. Your followers will see your latest content when they log in to their Medium accounts and browse their home newsfeed. Bonus: 3 tips for content creators with minimal time \nYou likely are asking yourself how you are supposed to create content for all of these channels and your own blog? For those who do not have the time to create unique content for multiple channels, there are a few options. Republish your own content. Some authors republish their content from one site to another, with credit to the original site. Change the length. If you have a massive 2,000-word post on your blog, you can summarize it as a post on LinkedIn, and then link to your original post for traffic value. Write related content. Let’s say that you’re writing a post about how to use Facebook ads on your own blog. You can write a related post about how to use Facebook Power Editor to submit to another publication, and find a way to link to the original post on your own blog as a reference. Grow your reach by publishing on other sites \nIf you follow these tips, you will be able to get more mileage out of the content you create so you can get added value from multiple channels. \nWant to explore how to get your content in front of and shared by influencers in your industry?

In their explanations for why Twitter ain’t what it used to be, critics often cite the proliferation of spam accounts : robots that exist purely for the sake of padding out follower numbers and hijacking hashtags. \nBut the robots that are really ruining Twitter aren’t these wholly automated fakers. They’re the semi-automated fakers: us. Many of us have long used tools that allow us to expedite our social media posting; for example, I’ve used Buffer and HootSuite for several years to pace my tweets and keep my social media presence active. But now these companies not only offer the ability to schedule tweets; they also can suggest tweets for you to post. \nBuffer offers “suggestions”; HootSuite , “suggested content.” Commun.it suggests the tweets that can thank and engage your most loyal followers. All these apps — and many more — are saving us from the problem of keeping up with social media by stripping away what was once the entire point of social media: actually using your own voice. The result is a Twitter that is authored by predictions and algorithms, rather than by humans. \nFor many users, that means Twitter offers a far less satisfying experience than it did just two or three years ago, when sharing a link often provoked follow-up comments and questions from people who’d actually read whatever you’d shared, or when tweeting a question could instantly elicit offers of help or insight. In on- and offline conversations with friends and colleagues, I frequently hear from folks like Michele Perras, a San Francisco-based design and product entrepreneur. “Twitter has become too much noise and not enough signal,” she says. “It used to be more like a hallway conversation, and now that’s harder to find that amongst the robotweeting and marketing.” \nTwitter has always included a lot of one-way broadcasting alongside its micro conversations; indeed, as a number of my Twitter enthusiast friends pointed out, part of its value is in offering a quick way of finding and consuming a wide range of must-read or must-see content. But the rise of suggested content tools has shifted the balance between conversation and link-sharing, and in so doing has diminished the value of the links that get shared. For all the folks who are relying on suggested tweets, a tweeted link no longer reflects any curation or judgment on their part; it may well be something that was found for them rather than by them. Nor is it a sign that they’ve even read what they’re sharing: as The Verge reported in a story about Upworthy last year that there’s no consistent relationship between whether people shared a story on social media, and whether they’d actually read it. \nI’m not immune to the temptations of suggested content myself. For much of the past year, I filled in the gaps in my tweeting by turning to Buffer’s “Daily,” a mobile app that suggests content for you to share, based on what you’ve previously posted. Launch the app on your phone, choose the network you want to post to, and Daily lets you page through a series of curated updates you can repost to your network of choice. Much like the dating app Tinder, Daily has made publishing or rejecting a tweet as easy as swiping right or left. Where it once took me an hour to queue up a week’s worth of tweets — by working my way through news stories and scheduling tweets based on the posts I found most interesting — I could now do it in 10 minutes. \nThough, as in the Verge’s story, I cut the corner of actually reading the links Daily would suggest. That shortcut fueled a vicious circle at both a micro and macro level: As an individual user, the more I relied on Daily to drive my tweeting, the less often I checked in on Twitter to find posts I might want to reply to or reshare; that made me still more dependent on Daily to find material for me to tweet. And of course, the more people engage in that kind of behaviour, the more soulless and monotonous Twitter itself becomes. \nEven though Daily was eroding my own experience with Twitter, the time it saved me made it irresistible – until I had an encounter with Buffer that made me see suggested content in a new light. Make that more than 500 encounters, actually: encounters with a steady stream of tweets linking to my July 2014 blog post for HBR,“ The Right Way to Unplug When You’re on Vacation .” \nThat post had attracted a fair amount of Twitter activity when it first went live in July 2014, and enjoyed another surge when HBR promoted it again over the December holidays. Not long after, Buffer added the post to its own queue of suggested content, and soon I was getting anywhere from a half-dozen to a couple dozen mentions a day, all from Buffer’s one suggested tweet. \nAt first, I was delighted: Who doesn’t like getting more Twitter mentions? But as the months wore on, I grew tired of having a Twitter feed that was full of monotonous, cookie-cutter references to the same post. Admittedly, when I conducted a quick and dirty survey of a dozen people who’d shared my post via Buffer, seven of them said they’d read the post in its entirety before tweeting, and only one person admitted to tweeting it entirely unread. But the post was getting only a little more traffic than HBR would normally expect for an eight-month-old post, and more telling, none of the last 50 people who’d tweeted the post actually followed me on Twitter. \nIf they were “engaged” by Buffer’s suggestion, it was a brief engagement that added little value to the online conversation. Some of the people who had shared the post when it was first published had added their own reflections in tweets like “ I still struggle with this ” or “ I read this article, just a little late ” and “Can any business owner really do this!?!” But the people who were tweeting out Buffer’s suggested content all posted the same, uniform tweet: “The Right Way to Unplug When You’re on Vacation by @awsamuel.” Not only is this less interesting for me as an author, but it’s symptomatic of the way that suggested content makes link-sharing less valuable and more boring: Where Twitter users once got context and insight with their shared links, now they’re just getting the titles of posts — and they can’t even trust that the sharer has read that piece of content. \nFinally, I decided to reclaim my Twitter mentions stream, and asked Buffer to unplug me from their list of suggested posts. They complied immediately, and their response pointed me toward a much happier tale of being on the receiving end of all those tweets . \nBut getting my post out of Buffer’s suggested content queue wasn’t enough to fully restore my passion for Twitter. I realized that to make my Twitter experience better, I had to be the kind of tweeter I wish to see in the world: someone who eschews the shortcut of suggested content apps and instead finds my own shareable content, enhancing it with my own reflections and commentary. \nThat doesn’t mean giving up on posting regularly, or even on using some shortcuts to make posting easier. But there’s a big difference between using these tools to make it easier to post the content you find, and using them to find it for you (maybe skipping the step of actually reading what you share). As I map out in Work Smarter with Social Media , you are better off using a news reader like feed.ly to find your own content — ideally based on searches you set up yourself, so you’re not tweeting the same stuff everybody else shares. Then you’ll not only share it but read it too — content that makes you more informed, with fresh information and perspectives that aren’t just borrowed from someone else’s crib sheet. \nIf we want Twitter — or any other online conversation — to be actually worthwhile, we have to be willing to put in at least that amount of effort. Otherwise we’ll be left with a social network where the only folks socializing are just robots, talking to other robots.

In the first half of 2015, mega-stars and indie auteurs alike turned to the medium to add a new layer to their existing tracks, and came up with some of the coolest clips in recent memory. From Taylor Swift beating bad guys to Shamir 's puppet theater to Maroon 5 's cheer-worthy wedding antics, these 10 music videos stood out from the hundreds released over the past six months. \nCheck out our unranked list of the 10 best music videos of 2015 (so far): \nSia, \"Elastic Heart\" \nFollowing up the \"Chandelier\" video should have been a difficult task for Sia; recasting Maddie Ziegler as a mini-Sia in a pseudo-sequel should have been impossible to pull off successfully. Instead, the enigmatic pop singer mined another imaginative concept involving a birdcage, Shia LaBeouf and a stunningly powerful expression of loss at its conclusion. \nMaroon 5, \"Sugar\" \nIf Maroon 5's \"Sugar\" is arguably the band's most irresistible pop-rock confection of its V era, then the \"Sugar\" music video is definitely the band's most unabashedly grin-inducing visual in recent memory. Only the coldest cynic could dismiss the charms of this multi-wedding sneak attack. \nTaylor Swift feat. Kendrick Lamar, \"Bad Blood\" \nLet's admit it: Taylor Swift's video for \"Style\" was a little too steely for such a free-wheeling song. Fortunately, Swift followed that visual up with one of the best of her career. The star-filled, action-packed clip for \"Bad Blood\" literally kicks ass, as Swift and her super-pals battle nameless baddies as Kendrick Lamar slides in for the remix. \nKendrick Lamar, \"King Kunta\" \nKendrick Lamar's To Pimp A Butterfly discusses a myriad of complex, entangled issues, but the single \"King Kunta\" is the album's most straightforward example of braggadocio, a king showing off his crown to his legion of followers. The sublime music video not only shows the beating heart of Compton, but Lamar owning, inspiring and thriving in his hometown. \nFKA Twigs, \"Glass & Patron\" \nFKA Twigs has produced some breathtaking visuals in her short career, but none has matched its outlandish concept with as much sonic cohesion as the video for \"Glass & Patron.\" Parts of this clip are downright stunning, from the multi-colored streamer struggle to the forest fashion show that Twigs leads during the twitching breakdown. \nCarly Rae Jepsen, \"I Really Like You\" \nSeriously, who doesn't want to watch Tom Hanks lip-sync to a bubblegum pop song while going about his day? Carly Rae Jepsen's \"I Really Like You\" isn't high-concept -- unless you think the concept of \"People like Tom Hanks and also Justin Bieber\" is high -- but then there's nothing wrong with a crowd-pleaser that actually pleases. \nShamir, \"Call It Off\" \nThis trippy disco strut was extremely likable before Shamir morphed into a megaphone-wielding puppet. As it stands, the \"Call It Off\" video remains one of the year's purest pleasures, with Puppet Shamir leading a pack of his puppet pals and imparting some sage relationship advice. \nNicki Minaj feat. Beyonce, \"Feeling Myself\" \nFlexing in a kiddie pool, mean-mugging next to classic cars, feasting on hamburgers and generally looking cooler than anyone else in the entire world: Nicki Minaj and Beyonce do all these things and more in the \"Feeling Myself\" music video, a document of two queens presiding over the desert and having a blast doing so. \nCourtney Barnett, \"Pedestrian at Best\" \n\"Put me on a pedestal, I'll only disappoint you,\" Courtney Barnett sings on the chorus of \"Pedestrian at Best,\" and the Australian rock phenom latched on the inevitability of that line and came up with the most inept clown of her time. That 'Clown of the Year - 2013' award doesn't mean much to Barnett's tormentors -- but at least she finds some company in the end. \nMadonna, \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" \nForget the all-star cameos by Katy Perry, Kanye West, Beyonce and Miley Cyrus -- no jammed-in cameos can steal the spotlight from Madonna's unhinged party scene, which includes booty-shaking, shot-taking, a bathtub make-out and Madge crowd-surfing like a wild teenager. \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" gloriously reiterates that that's what she is at heart.", :performance_score=>10, :spam_score=>0.0}, {:url=>"http://omgili.com/r/_0JOtn.4SCqblGjpMolZelQy0HYObfT7poow_P23zbsk4RGon8wvYq6TaIHRHin2y3sW9jlMKIlVdA0kIcfa5FutI2UeTHr64PXR6diYbiA-", :final_url=>"http://blog.hootsuite.com/10-ways-your-brand-is-wasting-time-on-facebook/", :published=>"2015-06-24T16:00:00.000+03:00", :title=>"Is Your Brand Wasting Time on Facebook? Stop Doing These 10 Things", :text=>"HootSuite Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google + \nFacebook has recently announced a new algorithm that measures the amount of time you spend looking at things on the network , so it’s a good time to re-evaluate your own company’s Facebook habits. We may all be familiar with the dangers of wasting time on personal News Feeds, but you might not even realize all the ways your business is wasting time on the network. And for company Pages, misused time has more serious consequences, such as missed revenue and professional networking opportunities. \nTo avoid any potential hurdles to your Facebook productivity, we’ve come up with a list of ways your business may be mismanaging important social media minutes. 10 ways your business is wasting time on Facebook Creating overly promotional content \nContent creation is time-consuming, and you don’t want those hours of hard work to go to waste. If you’ve been wondering about the reason for that drastic dip in your business’s organic reach, you probably haven’t heard our calls to halt the creation of overly promotional content . Facebook has been encouraging content creators on the network to replace the straight-up promo material with stories that add value or provide more history for your business’s products and services. These kinds of posts have a higher likelihood to be seen by bigger audiences. Posting Instagram pictures without context \nHere’s a thought process that might sound familiar: Instagram runs on beautiful images. Images increase engagement on Facebook. Instagram is part of Facebook. So I should repost all my Instagram photos automatically on my Facebook Page, right? \nWrong. Even if it may seem like a time-saving technique to automatically post the same update to multiple networks, it might cost you reach on both networks. For starters, your brand’s Instagram profile and Facebook Page may be serving different purposes , so content from one may not fit the overall tone of messaging on the other. Your audiences on the networks may also be drastically different, so what resonates with your Instagram followers may not quite jive with your Facebook fans. If you want to reuse a photo, make sure to provide enough context for it to make a meaningful, valuable Facebook post. Getting in comment wars \nEven if you have a sufficient number of customer support channels, it’s not unusual for people to reach out to you on Facebook. Don’t discourage this method of communication, and don’t engage in any sort of negative exchange . If a disgruntled customer comments on your Facebook post, reply quickly and reach out to them via Messenger. \nStay away from any negative Facebook comment threads from competitor brands. It’s important to be aware of these conversations, but participating in them isn’t necessary—especially if none of the negative claims are substantiated. You risk doing more damage to your online reputation if you do get involved in a comment war with your competition, especially if this is done at the expense of your engagement with followers and fans. Browsing Trending articles \nFacebook’s Trending sidebar shows the top three most discussed topics in your network. You can click on the headlines to discover more detailed information—but before you do, ask yourself if this topic is relevant to your work. The Trending sidebar provides a brief summary of the important details of the story, so unless the trending news is highly relevant to your industry or your audience’s interests, you shouldn’t browse the articles associated with it. Curiosity is not a bad trait; however, if you’re spending your time on Facebook reading about Tyra Banks’ selfie, you’re wasting precious time that could instead be spent talking to your followers. Always creating custom ads instead of boosting posts \nFacebook allows Page owners to put small amounts of cash on an existing post in order to boost its reach . This option can be a lot faster—and a lot cheaper!—than creating original advertisement content. While this shouldn’t be the only sponsored option you explore on Facebook, boosting posts is a fast and cost-effective way to test engagement from a new target demographic or a new type of media promotion. Depending on the results these boosted posts yield, you can then decide whether it’s worth investing a bigger budget into an ad. Skipping A/B tests for your Facebook ads \nAnother opportunity Facebook gives to businesses is running split tests on their ads to see which group performs better. This basically means sending out two slightly different versions of your ad to different target audiences, and see which one receives more engagements. Your Facebook Page admin may think they are saving time by skipping the testing stage, but in reality, this can be a huge missed opportunity. Facebook is a standalone advertising platform, and promoted content that works well for other networks may not get you the same numbers here. There are many elements you can test with your Facebook ad, such as placement, format, and copy length . Try out different variations with each ad you create, and note the winner of that category. Not only will this save you some time, it’ll also likely increase the return on investment on your Facebook ads. Taking too long to create a Facebook update \nThere is a lot of pressure to post updates that get likes, comments, and shares—and there are always days when your Facebook muse is absent. However, you don’t have hours to spend on composing a single update. If the inspiration just won’t come, do some productive social media browsing to find ideas . Another solution is asking your colleagues for advice: run your existing posts by knowledgeable coworkers to see what improvements can be made. \nYou can also take a look at posts that have performed well in the past, and repurpose this content for a new post . Try looking for content that can be updated with some new information, or a new angle. If after all these steps you’re still not satisfied with the Facebook post, maybe it’s a good day for some syndicated content. Reposting videos from external sources \nFacebook natively enabled video almost a year ago, and since then, content of that type has yielded amazing engagement results. So if you’re still embedding YouTube videos on your Page, you’re doing it wrong. Auto-playing Facebook videos encourage your followers to spend more time engaging with the content, which now registers with the network’s algorithm . Plus, posting Facebook videos and judging their performance can help you choose content for future video ads. Not completing your About section \nThis is another time sinkhole, with the solution in the category of “invest more time first, spend less time later.” If you don’t include all the necessary information about your company on your Facebook Page, you risk creating confusion among those who turn to that social account for details about your business. If you want to avoid spending time answering the same questions, provide a detailed description on the About section of your Page. This includes a brief description of your brand mission, a list of products or services you provide, a link to your official website, and a physical address, if your company has one. ‘Liking’ irresponsibly \nFinally, just like any other Facebook user, Facebook Page managers can like other people’s posts and Pages. In a similar fashion, businesses you’ve liked on Facebook show up in a Liked sidebar on your Page, so you must execute caution when pressing the ‘Like’ button. Your online properties are valuable real estate, so you don’t want visitors of your Page to see brands you wouldn’t necessarily endorse as a business. Select a few partners or clients to like, and let your Liked sidebar highlight your partnership. Plus, liking a Page authorizes new updates to appear on your News Feed, and you don’t want to create opportunities for distraction by liking Pages with low content quality.

I use Crystal to make better introductions \nCrystalKnows.com is a web tool and GMail plug-in that analyzes public information (LinkedIn, media quotes, blogs, etc.) written by or about an individual and help you better communicate with them by using algorithms to determine personality, communication style and more. \nThe tool gives you insights like “it comes naturally to this person to trust quickly,” and the GMail plug-in analyzes your emails to give you personalized and actionable tips like “be more brief” or “use emoticons.” With Crystal, you’ll be making better introductions, deeper connections, faster meetings and more. \nMelanie Deziel ( @mdeziel ), Creative Strategist at Time Inc. I use IFTTT to automate content sharing \nOne of my favorite IFTTT recipes is to save articles on Feedly and have them sent to my Buffer account. I find a bunch of things I want to share, save them all, and head over to Buffer to clean up the tweets. The automation saves a lot of cut-and-paste time and lets me focus on reading the articles I may want to share. \nI also use IFTTT to share my Instagram photos to Twitter as native Twitter photos so they show up in-stream. I have a few other IFTTT recipes that are time-savers, but I can’t give away all my secrets, now, can I? \nAmy Vernon ( @AmyVernon ), co-founder & CMO, Predictable.ly I use Grammarly to check my writing \nIf you’re working in the social media industry you know that any social media or digital marketing role comes with a big creative writing component. If you weren’t a writing major making sure you have perfect spelling and grammar while answering fans on the fly can be a tad time-consuming. Enter Grammarly. \nThis browser plug-in is free, easily to install and checks your writing across the web. It’s taken my post proofreading to a whole another level and enabled me to speed up and improve my responses to fans. Now if only I could plug it into my Outlook! \nGabrielle Archambault, Senior Manager Social Media & Community, eos Products I use Boomerang to schedule follow-up messages \nIf you’re trying to connect with someone prominent, they’re often extremely busy. Under those circumstances, “I’m swamped right now, but try me again in three weeks” is the best possible response you can hope for, because they’re not shutting the door and are inviting you to contact them again to set up a meeting. \nThis technique, which I’ve also sometimes used when receiving meeting requests, is a good vetting device; most people will forget to follow up and you’ll be off the hook. But when someone tells me this, I’ll immediately write a follow-up message on Boomerang (a Gmail plugin) and schedule it to send three weeks later. \nThat way, I don’t have to specifically remember to circle back, but I will have done so and kept the conversation alive. \nDorie Clark ( @DorieClark ), author of “ Stand Out ” and “Reinventing You” Hack ‘reply’ button on Twitter to hack growth and character limit \nOne of the things I love the most about Twitter is what most people hate the 140 character limit that forces us to keep our posts short, and sweet. Yes, it requires an ability to edit your post, and be able to express yourself in bullet points – which doesn’t come natural to most of us. \nLuckily, there is an easy way to overcome that obstacle of having too much to post, with too little space that boosts your post reach and engagement all at once. By simply replying to your own tweet you essentially connect tweets together in a thread, creating what is also know as a “tweet-storm” (storm of tweets). \nMarc Andreesen has perfected his tweet-storms by marking each tweet by number, notifying you the length of the thread. In addition using the reply feature to connect tweets allows you to follow up on new information related to an older tweet, and tell a better well rounded story. Also, connecting tweets into a thread gives mores exposure to the older posts that are rediscovered by a new audience. \nBecky Griffin ( @dorothyofisrael ), Basketball Columnist at Calcalist, Ex MTV VJ, Israeli Actress, and Supermodel I use Tweetfull to get high quality traffic from Twitter \nTweets only last 24 minutes and you need 24 hours of content flowing from your Twitter account. Tweetfull lets you select keywords and hashtags and it will retweet popular content based on sentiment analysis. This helps to keep your Twitter account engaged and always flowing with content. Don’t abuse it, keep it lite on your usage and you will see lots of engagement and account growth. \nMike Street, ( @MrMikeStreet ), Founder of Smart Black Voices and SF1M Digital Consulting I use Instagram tags to build targeted stories \nMy favorite social media hack is to create stories through tagging on Instagram. We all know that the only live link available to Instagram users is the one in your profile. However, with clever design and planning, you can create visual assets on multiple branded profiles that allow a user to pick and choose the path of engagement with your company. \nIt does take time to build every path seamlessly, but it can be a great and memorable way to connect with people. \nGary J. Nix ( @Mr_McFly ), Chief Strategy Office, bdot. I use Flutter-App to get more followers and traffic \nOne of the best ways to get more Twitter followers is to follow more people on Twitter. Flutter makes it easy to follow relevant people who are likely to follow you back. Following people is also a great way to get traffic, because when you follow someone, they get a notification, and can see your profile where you have a link to your website. To make it even easier to get more Twitter followers, and traffic from Twitter, I have my virtual assistant use Flutter for me. \nMike Fishbein ( @mfishbein ), Founder of Startup College , Serial Self-Published Author Build custom, user-profiled Facebook ads \nStop! Don’t boost that Facebook post. If you want the most bang for your buck, use Facebook’s ad platform to build your ad instead of just clicking “boost” on your Page. You’ll get more targeting options, A/B testing for graphical elements, and powerful reporting to help you drive down cost and drive up engagement! If you’ve got high-performing content that you’ve posted, use it as a base for your new ad, then add thoughtful targeting. \n“Lookalike” audiences allow Facebook to do the heavy lifting, and are often a good place to start if you don’t have specific demographic research to rely on. \nChad G. Abbott ( @ChadAbbott ), Managing Partner at Abbson Studios I use Twitter to make quick, meaningful connections \nWhen things get really busy and I don’t have a ton of time to craft a specific email introduction, I often just link the two people using their twitter handle and suggesting they connect. I also do this when someone mentions a need they have. I mention both people in the tweet and suggest they chat about the problem. It leads to notoriety for both people and chance for them to meet. \nMichael Roderick ( @michaelroderick ), CEO of Small Pond Enterprises and Founder of ConnectorCon I use third party apps to optimize Pinterest performance \nThird party apps, such as Piqora, Curalate, and Buffer, make it incredibly easy to track top-performing posts on Pinterest. You can see which images get the most repins, clicks, and comments, thus informing how you proceed with selecting and positioning content. Also, keeping an eye on your personal — not business — feed is exceptionally educational in terms of learning how non-media people use Pinterest and what they actually want to see. \nJulie Bogen ( @JaBogen ), Associate Social Media Editor at Refinery29 I use ScheduGram to manage Instagram scheduling \nThis tool is a game changer for the brands who have evergreen content on Instagram that they know they want to go out on a certain day or when there is a post that you want to go out at a certain time, but know you will be busy at that time – now you can schedule it. In your account you can have multiple brands and we all know we are still waiting for Instagram to get on the multiple logins train. Using ScheduGram you don’t have to login, logout, login, logout. \nInsider tip: Be sure to make good use of the first comment tool by adding relevant hashtags there and not in your caption. \nGabrielle Zigi ( @socialzigi ), Director of Digital Marketing at Firebrand Group I use Rapportive for Gmail to scale social connections \nRapportive shows me other places to connect with contacts who email me. In seconds I can see if we’re already connected online. And if we’re not connected, I can follow them on Twitter, or send an invitation to connect on LinkedIn directly from inside the email — all without leaving Gmail. \nBrooke Ballard ( @madsmscientist ), Chief Digital Strategist at B Squared Media I use Buffer to scale my use of social media to spend more time interacting \nBuffer allows me to quickly and easily pull my content and the content of others from across the web into a queue for sharing later in the day, week or month. This way it is easy for me to spend time on what really matters on social media: engaging with others, building relationships, consuming content, finding new people and businesses to source ideas and content from etc. Anything that saves me time to focus on the worthwhile processes on social media is worth the investment. \nBrian Honigman (@BrianHonigman), CEO of Honigman Media", :performance_score=>4, :spam_score=>0.0}, {:url=>"http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxAptkyFj4CwJEVwFwPmHtpuyMHg5zsPzfPraD_GKtr6lcTsd.Wkp6iCOiMw1SDopu3GtwXwKscoOXy82r6ze7Qj0yqLk4EcNjE1.n.j4nzi0fj8Xsh6EdeJYjmrE69NpVV9neO3mYm0hVtA--", :final_url=>"http://mashable.com/2015/06/25/meet-bubbles-the-2-legged-dog-that-runs-and-plays-with-his-3d-printed-cart/", :published=>"2015-06-25T21:36:00.000+03:00", :title=>"Bubbles the 2-legged dog runs around with his 3D-printed cart", :text=>"Bubbles the 2-legged dog runs around with his 3D-printed cart 0 2015-06-25 18:36:27 UTC \nThere's no slowing down Bubbles the dog . \nDespite being born with only two legs, this little pup has no troubling getting around, thanks to some handy 3D-printed carts. \nJudging by Bubbles' inability to sit still, it's safe to say that he's enjoying his mobility. \nScooters new skull wheels :) Terms Mashable is a leading global media company that informs, inspires and entertains the digital generation.

JUNE 25, 2015 Last year, the French Parliament passed a law barring unregistered drivers from picking up passengers, essentially banning the service. (Uber is contesting the constitutionality of parts of the law and has instructed its drivers to keep working.) Ms. Love seems to have been ensnared in the dispute while visiting Paris. A photograph posted Thursday to her Instagram account showed the window of her vehicle covered in what appeared to be egg . In her posts, Ms. Love snapped at the president of France, François Hollande, using several expletives and even more question marks to ask where the police were . “Is it legal for your people to attack visitors?” she wrote in one Twitter post. Ms. Love’s missives were widely circulated on Thursday: The one confronting Mr. Hollande received more than 8,000 retweets and 2,000 favorites by Thursday afternoon. She has nearly two million Twitter followers. Ms. Love also posted a video showing men knocking on the window of a vehicle and demanding that she and the driver get out of it. “How on earth are these people allowed to do this?” she asked in the caption of her post. “The first car was destroyed, all tires slashed and beat with bats, these guys trying to open the doors and the cops are doing nothing??” She continued: “I want to go home.” This is not the first time the rock star has attracted attention for her tweets. She won a libel case in January 2014 after a jury in Los Angeles determined that she did not defame her former lawyer on Twitter. And in 2011, she settled a libel case with a fashion designer who claimed that Ms. Love’s tweets ruined her reputation and her business. Ms. Love was not the only traveler whose itinerary was interrupted by the protests. Striking taxi drivers blocked the entrances to airports and train stations, and other disruptions were reported in Marseille, Aix-en-Provence, in the South, and Cannes, where an advertising festival was being held . Overturned black cars , some with their windows smashed , and burning tires blocked traffic in those cities and left some passengers stranded on the road. Mickael Flores, who identifies himself on Twitter as a TV journalist, posted a photograph of a fire in the middle of a street in Marseille. His tweet, in French, said, “Manifestation of anti-UberPop protest by Marseillais taxis who want to deactivate the app.”", :performance_score=>5, :spam_score=>0.0}, {:url=>"http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxAptkyFj4CwJEVwFwPmHtpuyMSnLuqjf8n9b7rqJAvvLDdvNMjl5.ePQ7", :final_url=>"http://mashable.com/2015/06/25/coach-k-twitter/", :published=>"2015-06-25T23:43:00.000+03:00", :title=>"Coach K uses a secret Twitter account to spy on Duke players", :text=>"Coach K uses a secret Twitter account to spy on Duke players 72 2015-06-25 20:43:21 UTC \nFresh off winning his fifth NCAA championship and with three players projected to be picked in the first round of Thursday's NBA Draft, it's clear Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski is doing many things right. \nAnd one of those things, the college basketball mastermind just revealed, is using a secret Twitter account to spy on his players. \nSee also: The most interesting men in the world: 2015 NBA Draft edition \n\"I follow guys. I don't want to be on Twitter because I don't care. I don't want their opinions. I don't need to show that I have X amount of followers. But I follow a lot of people on Twitter, under an alias,\" Coach K told ESPN.com on Wednesday. \"I tell my guys I'm following you. Then if I see something, you text them, you gotta watch. But there are a lot of cool things that they do. I do like that they do it.\" \nMore like Coach Kreeper, amirite? \nImage: Jim R. Bounds/Associated Press \nCoach K's watchful eye kept at least three star freshmen on the right track this past season. After winning big in their only year of college hoops, big man Jahlil Okafor, wing Justise Winslow and point guard Tyus Jones are all locks to be picked in the first round Thursday. \nOkafor, however, says Coach K may not be as slick as he thinks he is. \n“Everybody knows,” he told FTW.com on Thursday. “When we’re on the bus, we always see his phone. He has the words really big. So we don’t know his Twitter name but we know he sees us on Instagram, we know he sees us on Twitter.” \nLet this be a lesson for all wannabe Dukies: If you're a high school hotshot hoping to play for Coach K one day, he may well be tracking your tweets, too. Sports Fails 1. Golf Cart Fail \nThis runaway vehicle wreaked minor on-field havoc following a high school football championship in Texas last December. But a heroic bystander hopped aboard and put on the brakes. \nNo casualties occurred, and the clip immediately became Internet legend. 2. Penalty Kick Fail \nWatch out for the ricochet, goalie! This kid gets it in the right in the chops. 3. Mascot on Rollerblades Fail \nWhat happens when you put an inflatable dinosaur on rollerblades and ask it to skate down a flight of stairs? Amazingness, that's what. 4. Flopping Fail \nIn sports, to \"flop\" is to exaggerate the force of contact in hopes of drawing a favorable call from officials. But you've got to time it much, much better than this guy does. 5. Hockey Celebration Fail \nApparently, if you hug a member of the opposite team after scoring a goal in hockey, you will get punched in the face. 6. Innocent Bystander Fail \nThis kid is just in the wrong place at the wrong time...to the benefit of the rest of us. 7. Representing Your School Fail \nCollege football mascots are supposed to represent their schools in a fun, positive light — which doesn't typically include picking fights. Here, the University of Oregon's duck slams the University of Houston's cougar. \nBonus points for the sick elbow drop, though. 8. Weightlifting Fail \nNot saying we could successfully lift 432 pounds above our heads, but dang, that looks painful. \nGerman weightlifter Matthias Steiner dropped this massive barbell on his neck during the London Olympics this summer, but escaped serious injury. 9. Trampoline Dunk Fail \nSometimes, when you fail, you actually win. 10. Hurdling Fail \nWhy jump over hurdles when you could just RUN STRAIGHT THROUGH THEM? \nFile under: Never, Ever Gets Old. 11. Paying Attention Fail \nAfter what could best be described as an \"optimistic\" shot attempt in a game last season, NBA center JaVale McGee showed some nice hustle getting back on defense. Only problem? His team still had the ball. 12. Judgment Fail \nBut that wasn't McGee's only legendary moment. Here, he shows why it's not a good idea to try dunking from the free throw line mid-game. 13. Olympic Promo Fail \nFor some reason, London's Olympic promotions this summer involved hanging Mayor Boris Johnson on a zipline while waving a pair of tiny flags. \nThen he got stuck halfway through and it was pretty much the best, funniest, awkwardest thing that could have happened. 14. Grand Slam Celebration Fail \nMajor Leaguer Kendry Morales broke his lower left leg while celebrating a game-winning grand slam in 2010. This edited video provides the before, during and after rundown. 15. Slam Dunk Fail \nSee? White guys can jump? It's just the landing that's the hard part. 16. High Dive Fail \nThe announcer here sums it up perfectly. She calls this attempt from the 1992 Olympics \"an absolute failed dive.\" 17. Piggyback Ride Fail \nWhat begins as an innocent enough piggyback ride atop a fuzzy mascot turns into a pretty epic collision — and YouTube gold. 18. Long Jump Fail \nDude! If you're gonna pump up the crowd like that, you can't just faceplant into the sand. 19. Touchdown Celebration Fail \nWhen you think about it, is there any better way to celebrate a touchdown than by pegging an unsuspecting spectator in the face? Bonus points for originality, at least. 20. Pro Golfer Fail \nYou'd think a professional golfer could put the ball in the hole with less than 16 strokes. Kevin Na — and the rest of the world — found out otherwise on this par-four hole at the 2011 Valero Texas Open. 21. Head-First Slide Fail \nWell, that's one way of doing it...right? 22. Time Management Fail \nTie game, clock winding down — it's always better to get one last attempt up than just let the game go into overtime. A full court desperation heave with a 11 seconds to go is never the way to do it, however. \nThis classic gaffe by the University of Connecticut's Roscoe Smith came during a matchup of top teams in 2011. 23. Boogie Boarding Fail \nIts veracity may be suspect, but this 2008 YouTube classic has more than 12.7 million views, despite a mind-numbing soundtrack. 24. Sportsmanship Fail \nThe summer of 2011 was a tough time for NBA star LeBron James. It was full of lingering ill-will for his decision to the leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and snarky schadenfreude over his initial failure to win a championship with the Miami Heat. \nSo it makes perfect sense that he'd let off some steam by viciously dunking on a tiny kid at summer camp, right? That's what happens at the 0:43 mark of this video. 25. Standing on a Basketball Hoop Fail \nWe're not quite sure why this mascot thought standing on top of a basketball rim was a good idea.", :performance_score=>7, :spam_score=>0.0}, {:url=>"http://omgili.com/r/2wGaacqxAptkyFj4CwJEVwFwPmHtpuyMfGsAMqw7s0qFARtfvXhsA8_Z_zV.5F2W6iregEcN7c8KnOBQyWeTqg--", :final_url=>"http://mashable.com/2015/06/25/antonin-scalia-jiggery-pokery/", :published=>"2015-06-26T01:05:00.000+03:00", :title=>"Antonin Scalia's Obamacare dissent proves he's a secret 'Harry Potter' fan", :text=>"Antonin Scalia's Obamacare dissent proves he's a secret 'Harry Potter' fan 11 2015-06-25 22:05:36 UTC \nAccio justice. \nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, upset by the court's 6-3 decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act on June 25, read aloud a dissent filled with artistic word choices, including a term used by J.K.

Save us from the unemployment line. A Hillary Clinton supporter puts on a sticker at one of Clinton's campaign stops in Santee, S.C, on June 17, 2015. (Photo: David Goldman, AP) 4613 CONNECT 851 TWEET 39 LINKEDIN 449 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAs the high school girl who slept in a Hillary for President T-shirt for most of 2007, cried when she conceded to Barack Obama, railed at Congress during the Benghazi hearings and was an early follower of Texts from Hillary, I took heart from the 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign had created. \nWhen Hillary announced her second run for the White House, I felt my passion for politics reignite. I quickly applied for and was offered a position as a Hillary for America fellow to work on the campaign. I couldn't have been more excited — until I was told I'd have to move to Nevada and work full time on my own dime . \nI couldn't believe my ears. I did not apply as a routine volunteer but as a fellow. Its application process with an elaborate screening and interview process was now revealed to be an ugly lie. If Hillary hopes to inspire young people, to prove she understands our interests she should offer substance to earn our votes. \nCheap, cheap \nThe campaign's \"cheapness\" is being lauded as a successful step away from her failure in 2008. Voters are evidently supposed to feel pleased with Hillary's miserly commercial flights ( in first class ) and economical Amtrak trips while discounting her unpaid staff's out-of-pocket expenses as simply smart business. \nI had hoped a trailblazer would be more willing to break the mold of indentured servitude that haunts my generation. Finding out that Hillary perpetuates the exploitation known as unpaid internships was like discovering that Santa wasn't real. Ben Carson: Call it racism \nI guess I shouldn't be surprised. Unpaid work is common in campaigns, and as secretary of State, Hillary worked for the Obama administration. At the same time the administration was cracking down on unpaid internships in the private sector, it continued not paying the 300 annual interns in the White House. \nObama's wave of Millennial support in 2008 emphasized the importance of the youth vote. The Clinton campaign has already started to court young people as evident in her huge social media efforts right out of the gate, even enlisting Beyoncé. \nBut it doesn't bode well that a campaign seeking younger voters would callously overlook my generation's biggest struggle: employment. Nearly 14% of us are unemployed . After two straight years of unemployment, I thought things were looking up with a potential Hillary victory. \nInternships, once a prestigious foot-in-the-door experience, have increasingly been shown to be an abusive way for employers to gain free labor. I had bad experiences at unpaid internships in California and New York. I promised myself when I graduated two years ago to never let anyone do that to me again. \nMinimum wage \nFor a woman I supported to demand this of me felt repulsive. Forget arguments about raising the minimum wage. I can't even get a wage. What exactly are Hillary Clinton's priorities and how do I change them? \nI'm sure people will read this and think, \"Well, that's how it has always been. Who is this 20-something girl to complain?\" To that I say: the traditional family used to be the \"way it's always been,\" until we changed it. \nSo, Hillary, I ask you to question your role in this exploitative system. My generation is in trouble. Young people today are put in the impossible position of trading their self-worth just to survive. Glenn Reynolds: U.S. attorney chills Reason-able speech \nOur struggles are devalued as the first world problems of ungrateful children. At what point do the expectations that young people ought be grateful go too far? If we aren't getting paid, we should be grateful to have the experience. If we don't get the job, we should be grateful we even got the interview. If we're passed up for a promotion, we should be grateful we have a job. If we lose our job, we should be grateful we have a spouse or parent who can take care of us. At what point is it actually worse? \nIt might make me sound like a Stockholm syndrome victim, but after all of this, Hillary is still the best chance we have. If there is to be a better world for my future children, she's the only hope. \nHillary will get my free vote even if she will never have my free help. \nCarolyn G.
