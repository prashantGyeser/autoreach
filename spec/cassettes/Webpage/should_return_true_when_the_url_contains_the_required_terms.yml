        <p>When I went rock climbing for the first time, I had no idea what I was
        doing. My friends and I were complete newbies about ropes and rappelling and
        every other bit of jargon and technique that goes with climbing. We saw others
        doing it spectacularly well. We were thrilled at the thought of reaching the
        top of the climbing wall; we had no idea how to get there.</p>\n<p>I''d imagine
        that a social media marketing plan could feel the same way.</p>\n<p>If you''re
        starting from square one, it might feel equal parts thrilling and overwhelming.
        You know what you want to do and why. You can see that others have climbed
        the social media mountain; you''ve got few ideas how to get there yourself.</p>\n<p>It''d
        help to have a plan.</p>\n<p>We''ve shared before about different parts of
        a social media marketing plan- <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-stats-you-need-to-know\">the
        data and research</a> and personal experience behind <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-automation-guide\">what
        works on social media</a>. Now we''re pleased to put it all into a cohesive,
        step-by-step blueprint that you can use to get started. If you need a social
        media marketing plan, start here.</p>\n<p>Oh, and our friends at  <a href=\"http://www.venngage.com/\">online
        infographic maker Venngage</a>  were kind enough to wrap all that follows
        into a <a href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan\">comprehensive
        infographic</a> that''s easy to keep, share and reference:</p>\n<h2><strong>Social
        Media Marketing Plan</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting at the ground flour and building
        up, here is our overview of how to create a social media marketing plan from
        scratch.</p>\n<p>I like to think of this plan like a roadtrip. Start out by
        pointing yourself in the right direction, then choose the way you''re going
        to get there, check in regularly to make sure you''re on track, and have some
        fun along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose your social networks</p>\n<p><strong>Step
        2:</strong> Fill out your profiles completely</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>
        Find your voice and tone</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick your posting
        strategy</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Analyze and test</p>\n<p><strong>Step
        6:</strong> Automate and engage</p>\n<h2><strong>Step 1: Which social media
        sites you should use</strong></h2>\n<a href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan-update\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/choose-networks.png\"></a>
        <p>Social media is as homogenous from network to network as soda pop is from
        brand to brand. Sure, it''s all social media, but <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/advice-on-growing-a-google-page\">Google+</a>
        and <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/twitter-tips-for-beginners\">Twitter</a>
        might as well be Mountain Dew and Pepsi. Each network is unique, with its
        own best practices, own style, and own audience.</p>\n<p>You should choose
        the social networks that best fit your strategy and <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/goal-setting-strategies\">the
        goals you want to achieve</a> on social media.</p>\n<strong>You don''t have
        to be on them all-just the ones that matter to you and your audience.</strong>
        <p>Some things to consider that can help you choose not only <em>which</em>
        social networks to try but also <em>how many</em> to try.</p>\n<p><strong>Time
        - </strong>How much time can you devote to a social network? Plan on at least
        an hour per day per social network, at least at the start. (Once you get going,
        tools like <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer</a> can help you save a
        bit of time.)</p>\n<p><strong>Resources </strong>- What personnel and skills
        do you have to work with? Visual social networks like <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/pinterest-marketing-tips\">Pinterest
        </a>and <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/instagram-growth\">Instagram</a>
        require <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/14-tools-to-make-engaging-images-for-your-social-media-posts\">images
        and photos</a>. Social networks like Google+ emphasize quality content. Do
        you have the resources to create what''s needed?</p>\n<p><strong>Audience</strong>
        - Where do your <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/find-audience-build-a-community\">potential
        customers hang out</a>? Which social network has the right demographics?</p>\n<p>For
        the latter part of this decision, you can reference the audience research
        and demographics from surveys like those conducted by Pew Research. For instance,
        Pew has complete data, collected last fall, of the <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/09/demographics-of-key-social-networking-platforms-2/\">demographics
        for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn</a>. Here is a side-by-side
        comparison of Facebook and Twitter demographics.</p>\n<h2>\n<a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/09/demographics-of-key-social-networking-platforms-2/\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Facebook-and-Twitter-demographics.png\"></a><strong>Step
        2: Fill out your profiles completely</strong>\n</h2>\n<p>One of our monthly
        checks here at Buffer is to visit each of our social media profiles and make
        sure that our avatars, cover photos, <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-to-write-a-professional-bio-for\">bio</a>,
        and profile info is up-to-date and complete. It''s a key part to our <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-audit\">social
        media audit</a>. A completed profile shows professionalism, cohesive branding,
        and a signal to visitors that you''re serious about engaging.</p>\n<p>Profiles
        will require two parts: visuals and text.</p>\n<p>For visuals, we aim for
        consistency and familiarity with <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/a-complete-guide-to-creating-awesome-visual-content\">the
        visuals we use on social media</a>. Our avatar on Twitter matches our avatar
        on Facebook. Our cover photo on Google+ is similar to our cover on LinkedIn.</p>\n<a
        href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan-update\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/visuals.png\"></a>
        <p>To create these images, you can consult a <a href=\"http://www.rakacreative.com/blog/post/social-media-image-sizes-always-up-to-date\">social
        media image size chart</a> that will show you the exact breakdown of dimensions
        for each photo on each network. For an even easier time of it, you can use
        a tool like <a href=\"http://canva.com\">Canva</a>, which comes with prebuilt
        templates that set the proper sizes for you.</p>\n<a href=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-15-at-4.27.22-PM.png\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-15-at-4.27.22-PM.png\"></a>
        <p>For text, your main area to customize is the bio/info section.  <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/how-to-write-a-professional-bio-for\">Creating
        a professional social media bio</a> can be broken down into six simple rules.</p>\n<p>\n</p><ol><li>Show,
        don''t tell: \"What have I done\" often works better than \"Who I am\"</li>\n\t<li>Tailor
        your keywords to your audience</li>\n\t<li>Keep language fresh; avoid buzzwords</li>\n\t<li>Answer
        the question of your potential followers: \"What''s in it for me?\"</li>\n\t<li>Be
        personal and personable</li>\n\t<li>Revisit often</li>\n</ol><h2><strong>Step
        3: Find your marketing voice and tone</strong></h2>\n<a href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan-update\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/voice-and-tone.png\"></a>
        <p>The temptation at this point might be to jump right in and start sharing.
        Just one more step before you do. <strong>Your foray into social media will
        be more focused and more on point if you come up with <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-marketing-voice-and-tone\">a
        voice and tone for your content</a></strong> right off the bat.</p>\n<p>To
        do so, you could spend time coming up with <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/marketing-personas-beginners-guide\">marketing
        personas</a> and debating the finer points of your mission statement and customer
        base. These are all well and good. However, for a social media marketing plan
        just getting off the ground, you can make this process a bit easier. <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-marketing-voice-and-tone\">Start
        with questions like these</a>:</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul><li>If your brand was a person,
        what kind of personality would it have?</li>\n\t<li>If your brand was a person,
        what''s their relationship to the consumer? (a coach, friend, teacher, dad,
        etc)</li>\n\t<li>Describe in adjectives what your company''s personality is
        not.</li>\n\t<li>Are there any companies that have a similar personality to
        yours? Why are they similar?</li>\n\t<li>How do you want your customers to
        think about your company?</li>\n</ul><p>At the end of this exercise, you should
        end up with a handful of adjectives that describe the voice and tone of your
        marketing. Consider this to keep you on track: Voice is the mission statement;
        tone is the implementation of that mission.</p>\n<p>MailChimp has created
        <a href=\"http://voiceandtone.com/\">a standalone website simply for its voice
        and tone</a>. Here''s an example of how they implement these qualities into
        their communication:</p>\n<img src=\"http://bufferblog.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2014-04-12-at-1.26.37-PM.png\"><p><strong>Cultivate
        a voice that delights your customers</strong>, then your customers will be
        thrilled to spread the love about you.</p>\n<h2><strong>Step 4: Pick your
        posting strategy</strong></h2>\n<p>What''s the ideal amount to post per day?
        How <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-often-post-social-media\">often
        should you post</a>? When should you post? What should you post? The solid
        gold, ironclad answer on questions like these is:</p>\n<p>It depends.</p>\n<p>So
        much of the social media experience is about your individual audience and
        niche. What works for you might not work for me, and you never know until
        you try (we''ll get to trying in step five).</p>\n<p>That being said, there
        is some pretty good data and insight about where to start. Here''s what we''ve
        found to be good jumping off points.</p>\n<a href=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Social-Media-Posting-Strategy.png\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Social-Media-Posting-Strategy.png\"></a>
        <h3><strong>What should you be posting?</strong></h3>\n<strong>Images are
        ideal.</strong> <p>The push toward <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/a-complete-guide-to-creating-awesome-visual-content\">visual
        content</a> has plenty of anecdotal evidence-as you browse the streams on
        Twitter and Facebook, you''re likely to see images all over. There''s data
        to back up this change: Image posts get more views, clicks, reshares, and
        likes than any other type of post. And it''s not even close.</p>\n<p>On Facebook,  <a
        href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/7-facebook-stats-you-should-know-for-a-more-engaging-page\">photos
        get 53% more likes, 104% more comments and 84% more click-throughs on links</a>
        than text-based posts.</p>\n<p>Same goes for Twitter. In a study of over two
        million tweets from verified users across a number of different industries,
        Twitter found that <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/2014/what-fuels-a-tweets-engagement\">photos
        have the greatest effect on retweets</a>.</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul><li>\n<strong>Photos</strong>
        average a 35% boost in Retweets</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Videos</strong> get
        a 28% boost</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Quotes</strong> get a 19% boost in Retweets</li>\n\t<li>Including
        a <strong>number</strong> receives a 17% bump in Retweets</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Hashtags</strong>
        receive a 16% boost</li>\n</ul><a href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan-update\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/visual-content.png\"></a>
        <h3>The 4:1 Strategy</h3>\n<p>Now that you know what works, you can place
        these different types of updates into a consistent strategy. One of my favorite
        systems is the one <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/the-5-types-of-tweets-to-keep-your-buffer-full-and-your-followers-engaged\">used
        by Buffer''s co-founder Joel Gascoigne</a>. It works like this:</p>\n<p>\n</p><ol><li>Start
        with <strong>the basic five types of updates</strong> we all post: Links,
        images, quotes, reshares, plain-text updates</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Choose
        a \"staple\" update</strong>, a single type that will make up the majority
        of your shares</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Create a 4:1 ratio of sharing</strong>:
        for every four \"staple\" updates, publish one different type for variety</li>\n</ol><a
        href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan-update\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4-1-system.png\"></a>
        <p>This way your followers know what to expect from you, and you can hone
        your sharing to a specific type, making it easier to perfect and to experiment.</p>\n<p>(Note:
        You might won''t want to post the exact same updates across each of your social
        networks. Consider composing your updates in a unique way to complement each
        network''s own best practices, culture, and language.)</p>\n<h3><strong>How
        often should you be posting?</strong></h3>\n<p>There''s been a lot of interesting
        data out there about <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-often-post-social-media\">how
        often to post to social media</a>. Some of the factors that might impact your
        specific sharing frequency may include your industry, your reach, your resources,
        and the quality of your updates. The social network you''re using will have
        its own best practices, too.</p>\n<strong>If people love your updates, you
        can typically always get away with posting more.</strong> <p>For a specific
        number, here''re some guidelines we''ve put together based on some really
        helpful <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-frequency-guide\">research
        into how often to post to social media</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan-update\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/how-often.png\"></a>
        <h3><strong>When should you be posting?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are many neat
        tools to show you <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/best-time-to-tweet-post-to-facebook-send-emails-publish-blogposts\">the
        best time of day to post to Facebook, Twitter, and more</a>. These <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/best-social-media-tools-for-small-business\">tools</a>
        look at your followers and your history of posts to see when your audience
        is online and when historically have been your best times to share.</p>\n<p>So
        what''s someone to do who''s just starting out on these social networks, with
        no audience and no history?</p>\n<p>Again, this is where best practices come
        in. Perhaps the most helpful (and adorable) infographic I''ve seen about timing
        comes from SumAll, which <a href=\"http://blog.sumall.com/journal/timing-everything-post-smarter-meow.html\">compiled
        timing research</a> from sites like Visual.ly, Search Engine Watch, and Social
        Media Today to create its awesome visual. Here''s an overview of what they
        found in terms of timing (all times are Eastern Time).</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul><li>\n<strong>Twitter</strong>
        - 1-3pm weekdays</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Facebook</strong> - 1-4pm and 2-5pm
        weekdays</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>LinkedIn</strong> - 7-8:30am and 5-6pm Tuesday,
        Wednesday, and Thursday</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Tumblr</strong> - 7-10pm weekdays
        and 4pm on Fridays</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Instagram</strong> - 5-6pm weekdays
        and 8pm on Mondays with a sweetspot at 6pm</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Pinterest</strong>
        - 2-4pm and 8-11pm weekdays with weekends being the best</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Google+</strong>
        - 9-11am weekdays</li>\n</ul><a href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan-update\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/optimal-times.png\"></a>
        <h2><strong>Step 5: Analyze, test, and iterate</strong></h2>\n<p>Remember
        how we talked about social media sharing being a very individual, specific
        endeavor? Your stats will likely start to bear this out.</p>\n<strong>The
        more you post, the more you''ll discover which content, timing, and frequency
        is right for you.</strong> <p>How will you know? It''s best to get <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/time-saving-social-media-tools\">a
        reporting tool</a>. Most major social networks will have basic analytics built
        into the site; it''s just a little easier to seek and find this information
        from an all-encompassing dashboard.</p>\n<p>These tools (I''ll use <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer''s
        analytics</a> as an example) can show you a breakdown of how each post performed
        in the important areas of views, clicks, shares, likes, and comments.</p>\n<a

        <p><a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/definitive-guide-social-media-metrics-stats\">Which
        social media stats are best?</a> We''ve gained some insight from looking at
        each of these main statistics and the composite engagement stat on a per-post
        basis. The resulting stat gives us a great look, over time, of how our social
        media content tends to perform, and we can then test and iterate from there.</p>\n<p>Here''s
        one way this analysis step.</p>\n<p><strong>Set a benchmark</strong>. After
        two weeks or a month of sharing, you can go back through your stats and find
        the average number of clicks, shares, likes, and comments per post. This''ll
        be your benchmark going forward. You can come back and update this number
        at any time as your following and influence grows.</p>\n<p><strong>Test something
        new.</strong> We''re open to testing just about anything at Buffer. We''re
        in the midst of some tests right now on our Twitter account. Do Twitter-optimized
        images gain more clicks than non-optimized images? Does capitalization matter?
        We''ll often hear about someone''s new strategy or get a new idea and then
        test right away.</p>\n<p><strong>Did it work?</strong> Check the stats from
        your test versus the stats of your benchmark. If your test performed well,
        then you can implement the changes into your regular strategy. And once your
        test is over, test something new!</p>\n<a href=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Add-text.png\"><img

        <h2><strong>Step 6: Automate, engage, and listen</strong></h2>\n<p>The final
        piece of a social media marketing plan involves having a system you can follow
        to help you stay on top of updates and engaged with your community.</p>\n<p>To
        start with, automate your updates. Tools like <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer</a>
        allow you to create all the content and updates that you want to, all at once,
        and then place everything into a queue to be sent out according to whatever
        schedule you choose. <strong><a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-automation-guide\">Automation
        is the secret weapon</a> for consistently excellent sharing, day after day.</strong></p>\n<p>Your
        plan doesn''t end with automation, though. <strong>Social media requires engagement,
        too.</strong> When people talk to you, talk back. Set aside time during your
        day to followup with conversations that are happening on social media. These
        are conversations with potential customers, references, friends, and colleagues.
        They''re too important to ignore.</p>\n<p>One way to stay up on all the conversations
        that are happening around you and your company is to create a system for listening.
        Tools like <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/mention-and-buffer-partner-for-a-better-way-to-monitor-and-publish-on-social-media\">Mention</a>
        will send you an alert every time you''re mentioned online, and you can rely
        on custom searches and email alerts for mentions on specific networks, too.</p>\n<h2><strong>What
        would you share with someone new to social media?</strong></h2>\n<p>Coming
        up with a social media marketing plan is a great step toward diving in to
        social. If social media looks thrilling and overwhelming all at once, start
        with a plan. Once you see the blueprint in front of you, it''s a little easier
        to see what lies ahead.</p>\n<p>\n</p><ol><li>Pick your networks</li>\n\t<li>Fill
        out your info</li>\n\t<li>Find your voice</li>\n\t<li>Choose your strategy</li>\n\t<li>Analyze
        and test</li>\n\t<li>Automate and engage</li>\n</ol><p>Bingo!</p>\n<p>How
        did you develop your social media strategy? I''d love to keep the conversation
        going in the comments. If you know someone who could use this, feel free to
        pass this along. If you can use it yourself, let me know how it goes!<br><a
