        efforts to create content that attracts attention and encourages readers to

        networks</a>. The resulting electronic word of mouth (eWoM) refers to any
        statement consumers share via the Internet (e.g., web sites, social networks,
        instant messages, news feeds) about an event, product, service, brand or company.
        When the underlying message spreads from user to user and presumably resonates
        because it appears to come from a trusted, third-party source, as opposed
        to the brand or company itself, this form of marketing results in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_media\">earned

        networking websites</a> allow individuals and businesses to interact with
        one another and build relationships and communities online. When companies
        join these social channels, consumers can interact with them directly. That
        interaction can be more personal to users than traditional methods of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_communications\">outbound
        marketing</a> &amp; advertising.</p>\n<p>Social networking sites act as <a
        href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_mouth\">word of mouth</a>. Social
        networking sites and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogs\">blogs</a>
        allow followers to \"retweet\" or \"repost\" comments made by others about
        a product being promoted. By repeating the message, the user''s connections
        are able to see the message, therefore reaching more people. Because the information
        about the product is being put out there and is getting repeated, more traffic
        is brought to the product/company.</p>\n<p>Social networking websites are
        based on building virtual communities, that allow consumers to express their
        needs, wants and values, online. Social Media Marketing then connects these
        consumers and audiences to businesses that share the same needs, wants and
        values.</p>\n<p>Through social networking sites, companies can interact with
        individual followers. This personal interaction can instill a feeling of <a
        href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty\">loyalty</a> into followers
        and potential customers. Also, by choosing whom to follow on these sites,
        products can reach a very narrow target audience.</p>\n<p>Social networking
        sites also include a vast amount of information about what products and services
        prospective clients might be interested in. Through the use of new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics\">Semantic</a>
        Analysis technologies, marketers can detect buying signals, such as content
        shared by people and questions posted online. Understanding of buying signals
        can help sales people target relevant prospects and marketers run micro-targeted
        campaigns.</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul><li>Selection of potential Social Networks to

        phone</a> usage has also become beneficial for social media marketing. Today,
        most cell phones have social networking capabilities: individuals are notified
        of any happenings on social networking sites through their cell phones, in
        real-time. This constant connection to social networking sites means products
        and companies can constantly remind and update followers about their capabilities,
        uses, importance, etc. Because cell phones are connected to social networking
        sites, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertisements\">advertisements</a>
        are always in sight. Also many companies are now putting QR codes along with
        products for individuals to access the company website or online services
        with their smart-phones.</p>\n<p>There are two basic strategies for engaging
        the social media as marketing tools:</p>\n<p>Social media can be a useful
        source of market information and customer voice. Blogs, content communities
        and forums are platforms where individuals share their reviews and recommendations
        of brands, products and services. Businesses are able to tap and analyze the
        customer voice generated in social media for marketing purposes; in this sense
        the social media is an inexpensive source of market intelligence which can
        be used by marketers to track problems and market opportunities. For example,
        the internet erupted with videos and pictures of iPhone 6 bend test which
        showed that the coveted phone would bend merely by hand. The so-called \"bendgate\"
        controversy created confusion amongst customers who had waited months for
        the launch of the latest rendition of the iPhone. However Apple promptly issued
        a statement saying that the problem was extremely rare and that the company
        had taken several steps to make the mobile device robust. Unlike traditional
        market research methods such as surveys, focus groups and data mining which
        are time consuming and costly, marketers can now utilize social media to obtain
        ''live'' information about consumer behavior. This can be extremely useful
        in a highly dynamic market structure in which we now live.</p>\n<p>Social
        media can be used not only as public relations and direct marketing tools
        but also as communication channels (targeting specific audiences with social
        media influencers) and as customer engagement tools. There are several examples
        of firms initiating some form of online dialog with the public to foster relations
        with customers. According to Constantinides, Lorenzo and G&#243;mez Borja
        (2008) \"Business executives like Jonathan Swartz, President and CEO of Sun
        Microsystems, Steve Jobs CEO of Apple Computers, and McDonalds Vice President
        Bob Langert post regularly in their CEO blogs, encouraging customers to interact
        and freely express their feelings, ideas, suggestions or remarks about their
        postings, the company or its products\". Using customer influencers (for example
        popular bloggers) can be a very efficient and cost-effective method to launch
        new products or services Narendra Modi current prime minister of India ranks
        only second after President Barack Obama in number of fans on his official
        Facebook page at 21.8 million and counting. Modi employed social media platforms
        to circumvent traditional media channels to reach out to the young and urban
        population of India which is estimated to be 200 million. His appeal was further
        buttressed by the recent crowd turnout at Madison square garden.<sup>[<i><a
        href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\">irrelevant
        citation </a></i>]</sup></p>\n<p>In the context of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_web\">social
        web</a>, <b>engagement</b> means that customers and stakeholders are participants
        rather than viewers. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media\">Social
        media</a> in business allows all consumers to express and share an opinion
        or an idea somewhere along the business''s path to market. Each participating
        customer becomes part of the marketing department, as other customers read
        their comments or reviews. The engagement process is then fundamental to successful
        social media marketing.</p>\n<p>Engagement in social media for the purpose
        of your social media strategy is divided into two parts:</p>\n<p>1. Proactive
        posting of new content and conversations, as well as the sharing of content
        and information from others</p>\n<p>Traditional media is limited to one way
        interaction with customers or ''push and tell'' where only specific information
        is given to the customer without any mechanism to obtain customer feedback.
        On the other hand, social media is participative where customer are able to
        share their views on brands, products and services. Traditional media gives
        the control of message to the marketer whereas social media shifts the balance
        to the consumer.</p>\n<p>Social networking sites can have a large impact on
        the outcome of events. In 2010, a Facebook campaign surfaced in the form of
        a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petition\">petition</a>. Users virtually
        signed a petition asking <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Universal\">NBC
        Universal</a> to have actress <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_White\">Betty
        White</a> host <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live\">Saturday
        Night Live</a>. Once signed, users forwarded the petition to all of their
        followers. The petition went viral and on May 8, 2010, Betty White hosted
        SNL.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2008\">2008
        US presidential campaign</a> had a huge presence on social networking sites.
        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama\">Barack Obama</a>, a
        virtually unknown <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic\">Democratic</a>
        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate\">candidate</a>, utilized
        15 different social media websites to form relationships with the millions
        of American citizens who utilize those networks. His social networking profile
        pages were constantly being updated and interacting with followers. By the
        end of his campaign, Obama had 5 million social media network supporters (2.5
        million on Facebook and 115,000 on Twitter). The use of social networking
        sites in his marketing campaign gave Barack Obama''s campaign access to <a
        href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail\">e-mail</a> addresses, as posted
        on social network profile pages. This allowed the Democratic Party to launch
        e-mail campaigns asking for votes and campaign donations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_businesses\">Small
        businesses</a> also use social networking sites as a promotional technique.
        Businesses can follow individuals social networking site uses in the local
        area and advertise specials and deals. These can be exclusive and in the form
        of \"get a free drink with a copy of this tweet\". This type of message encourages
        other locals to follow the business on the sites in order to obtain the promotional
        deal. In the process, the business is getting seen and promoting itself (brand
        visibility).</p>\n<p>A short film released on March 5, 2012, by humanitarian

        main purposes in employing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Media\">Social
        Media</a> in marketing is as a communications tool that makes the companies
        accessible to those interested in their product and make them visible to those
        who have no knowledge of their products. These companies use social media
        to create buzz, learn from and target customers. It''s the only form of marketing
        that can finger consumers at each and every stage of the consumer decision
        journey. Marketing through social media has other benefits as well. Of the
        top 10 factors that correlate with a strong Google organic search, seven are
        social media dependent. This means that if brands are less or non active on
        social media, they tend to show up less on Google searches. While platforms
        such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter\">Twitter</a>, <a
        href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B\">Google+</a>
        have a larger amount of monthly users, The visual media sharing based mobile
        platforms however, garner a higher interaction rate in comparison and have
        registered the fastest growth and have changed the ways in which consumers
        engage with brand content. Instagram has an interaction rate of 1.46% with
        an average of 130 million users monthly as opposed to Twitter which has a
        .03% interaction rate with an average of 210 million monthly users. Unlike
        traditional media that are often cost-prohibitive to many companies, a social
        media strategy does not require astronomical budgeting. To this end, companies
        make use of platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube\">YouTube</a>
        and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram\">Instagram</a> in order
        to reach audiences much wider than through the use of traditional print/TV/radio
        advertisements alone at a fraction of the cost, as most social networking
        sites can be used at no cost. This has changed the ways that companies approach
        interact with customers, as a substantial percentage of consumer interactions
        are now being carried out over online platforms with much higher visibility.
        Customers can now post reviews of products and services, rate customer service
        and ask questions or voice concerns directly to companies through social media
        platforms. Thus social media marketing is also used by businesses in order
        to build relationships of trust with consumers. To this aim, companies may
        also hire personnel to specifically handle these social media interactions,
        who usually report under the title of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_community_manager\">Online
        community managers</a>. Handling these interactions in a satisfactory manner
        can result in an increase of consumer trust. To both this aim and to fix the
        public''s perception of a company, 3 steps are taken in order to address consumer
        concerns, identifying the extent of the social chatter, engaging the influencers
        to help, and developing a proportional response.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter\">Twitter</a>

        characters which appear on followers'' <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_page\">home
        pages</a>. Messages can link to the product''s website, Facebook profile,
        photos, videos, etc. Twitter is also used by companies to provide customer
        service. Some companies make support available 24/7 and answer promptly, thus
        improving brand loyalty and appreciation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook\">Facebook</a>
        pages are far more detailed than Twitter accounts. They allow a product to

        a professional business-related networking site, allows companies to create
        professional profiles for themselves as well as their business to network

        social networking activities, such as Twitter stream or blog entries of their
        product pages, onto their LinkedIn profile page. LinkedIn provides its members
        the opportunity to generate sales leads and business partners. Members can
        use \"Company Pages\" similar to Facebook pages to create an area that will
        allow business owners to promote their products or services and be able to
        interact with their customers. Due to spread of spam mail sent to job seeker,
        leading companies prefer to use LinkedIn for employee''s recruitment instead
        using different job portals. Additionally, companies have voiced a preference
        for the amount of information that can be gleaned from LinkedIn profile, versus
        a limited email.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelp,_Inc.\">Yelp</a>

        to create a page or create a new/claim an existing venue. A good marketing
        strategy for businesses to increase foot traffic or retain loyal customers
        includes offering incentives such as discounts or free food/beverages for
        people checking into their location.</p>\n<p>In May 2014, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram\">Instagram</a>
        had over 200 million users. The user engagement rate of Instagram was 15 times
        higher than of Facebook and 25 times higher than that of Twitter. According
        to Scott Galloway, the founder of L2 and a professor of marketing at New York
        University''s Stern School of Business, latest studies estimate that 93 percent
        of prestige brands have an active presence on Instagram and include it in
        their marketing mix. When it comes to brands and businesses, Instagram''s
        goal is to help companies to reach their respective audiences through captivating
        imagery in a rich, visual environment. Moreover, Instagram provides a platform
        where user and company can communicate publicly and directly, making itself
        an ideal platform for companies to connect with their current and potential
        customers.</p>\n<p>Many brands are now heavily using this mobile app to boost
        their visual marketing strategy. Instagram can be used to gain the necessary
        momentum needed to capture the attention of the market segment that has an
        interest in the product offering or services. As Instagram is supported by
        Apple and android system, it can be easily accessed by smart phone users.
        Moreover, it can be accessed by Internet as well. Thus, the marketers see
        it as a potential platform to expand their brands exposure to the public,
        especially the younger target group. On top of this, marketers do not only
        use social media for traditional Internet advertising, but they also encourage
        users to create attention for a certain brand. This generally create an opportunity
        for greater brand exposure. Furthermore, marketers are also using the platform
        to drive social shopping and inspire people to collect and share pictures
        of their favorite products. Many big names have already jumped on board: <a

        are a few examples of multinationals that adopted the mobile photo app early.</p>\n<p>Instagram
        has proven itself a powerful platform for marketers to reach their customers
        and prospects through sharing pictures and brief messages. According to a
        study by Simply Measured, 71 percent of the world''s largest brands are now
        using Instagram as a marketing channel. For companies, Instagram can be used
        as a tool to connect and communicate with current and potential customers.
        The company can present a more personal picture of their brand, and by doing
        so the company conveys a better and true picture of itself. The idea of Instagram
        pictures lies on on-the-go, a sense that the event is happening right now,
        and that adds another layer to the personal and accurate picture of the company.
        Another option Instagram provides the opportunity for companies to reflect
        a true picture of the brand through the perspective of the customers, for
        instance, using the user-generated contents thought the hashtags encouragement.
        Other than the filters and hashtags functions, the Instagram''s 15-second
        videos and the recently added ability to send private messages between users
        have opened new opportunities for brands to connect with customers in a new
        extent, further promoting effective marketing on Instagram.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube\">YouTube</a>
        is another popular avenue; advertisements are done in a way to suit the target
        audience. The type of language used in the commercials and the ideas used
        to promote the product reflect the audience''s style and taste.</p>\n<p>Also,
        the ads on this platform are usually in sync with the content of the video
        requested, this is another advantage YouTube brings for advertisers. Certain
        ads are presented with certain videos since the content is relevant. Promotional
        opportunities such as sponsoring a video is also possible on YouTube, \"for
        example, a user who searches for a YouTube video on dog training may be presented
        with a sponsored video from a dog toy company in results along with other
        videos.\" YouTube also enable publishers to earn money through its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Partner_Program\">YouTube

        sites used in social media promotion. Each of these sites is dedicated to
        the collection, curation, and organization of links to other websites. This
        process is crowdsourced, allowing members to sort and prioritize links by
        relevance and general category. Due to the large user bases of these websites,
        any link from one of them to another, smaller website usually results in a
        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_crowd\">flash crowd</a>. In
        addition to user generated promotion, these sites also offer advertisements
        within individual user communities and categories. Because ads can be placed
        in designated communities with a very specific target audience and demographic,
        they have far greater potential for traffic generation than ads selected simply
        through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie\">cookie</a> and
        browser history. Additionally, some of these websites have also implemented
        measures to make ads more relevant to users by allowing users to vote on which
        ones will be shown on pages they frequent. The ability to redirect large volumes
        of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_traffic\">web traffic</a> and
        target specific, relevant audiences makes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bookmarking\">social
        bookmarking</a> sites a valuable asset for social media marketers.</p>\n<p>Platforms
        like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn\">LinkedIn</a> create
        an environment for companies and clients to connect online. Companies that
        recognize the need for information, originality, and accessibility employ
        blogs to make their products popular and unique, and ultimately reach out
        to consumers who are privy to social media.</p>\n<p>Blogs allow a product
        or company to provide longer descriptions of products or services, can include
        testimonials and can link to and from other social network and blog pages.
        Blogs can be updated frequently and are promotional techniques for keeping
        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customers\">customers</a>, and also
        for acquiring followers and subscribers who can then be directed to social
        network pages.</p>\n<p>Online communities can enable a business to reach the
        clients of other businesses using the platform. To allow firms to measure
        their standing in the corporate world, sites like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassdoor\">Glassdoor</a>
        enable employees to place evaluations of their companies. Some businesses
        opt out of integrating social media platforms into their traditional marketing
        regimen. There are also specific corporate standards that apply when interacting
        online. To maintain an advantage in a business-consumer relationship, businesses
        have to be aware of four key assets that consumers maintain: information,
        involvement, community, and control.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr\">Tumblr</a>
        first launched ad products on May 29, 2012. Rather than relying on simple
        banner ads, Tumblr requires advertisers to create a Tumblr blog so the content

        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter\">Twitter</a> provide advertisers
        with information about the likes and dislikes of their consumers. This technique
        is crucial, as it provides the businesses with a \"target audience\". With
        social networks, information relevant to the user''s likes is available to
        businesses; who then advertise accordingly.</p>\n<p>Activities such as uploading
        a picture of your \"new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_(shoe_company)\">Converse</a>
        sneakers to Facebook\" is an example of a <i>COBRA</i>. Electronic recommendations
        and appraisals are a convenient manner to have a product promoted via \"consumer-to-consumer
        interactions. An example of <i>eWOM</i> would be an online hotel review; the
        hotel company can have two possible outcomes based on their service. A good
        service would result in a positive review which gets the hotel free advertising
        via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media\">social media</a>,

        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Egyptian_revolution\">2011 Egyptian
        Revolution</a> drew objection from the public; it was widely objected to on
        the Internet. Kenneth Cole realized his mistake shortly after and responded
        with a statement apologizing for the tweet.</p>\n<p>In 2012 during Hurricane
        Sandy, Gap sent out a tweet to its followers telling them to stay safe but
        encouraged them to shop online and offered free shipping. The tweet was deemed
        insensitive and Gap eventually took it down and apologized.</p>\n<p>Numerous
        additional online marketing mishap examples exist. Examples include a YouTube
        video of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino%27s_Pizza\">Domino''s
        Pizza</a> employee violating health code standards, which went viral on the
        internet and later resulted in felony charges against two employees. A Twitter
        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag\">hashtag</a> posted by <a
        href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s\">McDonald''s</a> in 2012
        attracting attention due to numerous complaints and negative events customers
        experienced at the chain store; and a 2011 tweet posted by a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Group\">Chrysler
        Group</a> employee that no one in Detroit knows how to drive. When <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Link_REIT\">the
        Link REIT</a> opened a Facebook page to recommend old-style restaurants, the
        page was flooded by furious comments criticising the REIT for having forced
        a lot of restaurants and stores to shut down; it had to terminate its campaign
        early amid further deterioration of its corporate image.</p>\n<p>The code
        of ethics that is affiliated with traditional marketing can also be applied
        to social media, however with social media being so personal and international,
        there is another list of complications and challenges that comes along with
        being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no
        longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given
        from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers like to
        hear from advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants
        are. The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network
        sites is to be honest with the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising,
        be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers'' private
        information for gain),respect the dignity of persons in the shared online
        community, and claim responsibility of any mistakes or mishaps that are results
        of your marketing campaign. Most social network marketers use websites like
        Facebook and MySpace to try to drive traffic to another website. While it
        is ethical to use social networking websites to spread a message to people
        who are genuinely interested, many people game the system with auto-friend
        adding programs and spam messages and bulletins. Social networking websites
        are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding
        out and banning offenders.</p>\n<p>In addition, social media platforms have
        become extremely aware of their users and collect information about their
        viewers to connect with them in various ways. Social-networking web site Facebook
        Inc. is quietly working on a new advertising system that would let marketers
        target users with ads based on the massive amounts of information people reveal
        on the site about themselves This may be an unethical or ethical feature to
        some individuals. Some people may react negatively because they believe it
        is an invasion of privacy. On the other hand, some individuals may enjoy this
        feature because their social network recognizes their interests and sends
        them particular advertisements pertaining to those interests. Consumers like
        to network with people who have interests and desires that are similar to
        their own Individuals who agree to have their social media profile public,
        should be aware that advertisers have the ability to take information that
        interests them to be able to send them information and advertisements to boost
        their sales. Managers invest in social media to foster relationships and interact
        with customers This is an ethical way for managers to send messages about
        their advertisements and products to their consumers.</p>\n<p>The end goal
        of any marketing effort is to generate sales. Although social media is a useful
        marketing tool, it is often difficult to quantify to what extent it is contributing
        to profit. ROI can be measured by comparing marketing analytic value to contact
        database or CRM and connect marketing efforts directly to sales activity.</p>\n<p>Popular
        social media such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social networks
        can provide marketers with a hard number of how large their audience is nevertheless
        a large audience may not always translate into a large sales volumes. Therefore
        an effective SMM cannot be measured by a large audience but rather by vigorous
        audience activity such as social shares, retweets etc.</p>\n<p>\n</p><ol><li>Trattner,

        programs usually center on efforts to create content that attracts attention
        and encourages readers to share it with their social networks. A corporate
        message spreads from user to user and presumably resonates because it appears
        to come from a trusted, third-party source, as opposed to the brand or company
        itself. Hence, this form of marketing is driven by word-of-mouth, meaning
        it results in earned media rather than paid media.</p>\n<p>Social media has
        become a platform that is easily accessible to anyone with internet access.
        Increased communication for organizations fosters brand awareness and often,
        improved customer service. Additionally, social media serves as a relatively
        inexpensive platform for organizations to implement marketing campaigns.</p>\n<p>Social

        is social media?</h2>\n<p><strong>\"Social media\"</strong> is a way for people
        to communicate and interact online. While it has been around since the dawn
        of the World Wide Web, in the last 10 years or so we''ve seen a surge in both
        the number and popularity of social media sites. It''s called social media
        because users engage with (and around) it in a social context, which can include
        conversations, commentary, and other user-generated annotations and engagement
        interactions.</p>\n<p>Publishing content has become exponentially simpler
        over the last several years, which has helped skyrocket the use of social
        media. Non-technical web users are now able to easily create content on a
        rapidly growing number of platforms, including those that are owned (hosted
        communities, blogs, etc.), rented (social networks or third-party communities),
        and occupied (commenting, contributing, etc.). Today''s web has shifted from
        a \"one-to-many\" to a \"many-to-many\" method of engagement, and we''re loving
        it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://dc8hdnsmzapvm.cloudfront.net/assets/images/guides/social_beginners/chapter_01/what_is_social_media.png?311668a\"><p>For
        businesses, the shift in web consumerism and accompanying rise in social media
        brings both opportunity and responsibility. The sheer amount of data that
        customers make available through social media alone has web marketers jumping
        for joy. The real magic, however, lies in the opportunity to grow lasting
        and scalable relationships with your organization''s customer base through
        social media. This is also where your online responsibility to your customers
        begins to take shape. Just as your customers'' behavior has shifted, so have
        their expectations for yours. Whether your business is listening and engaging
        or not, customers are having conversations relevant to your operations. It''s
        better to be part of the conversation, right? We sure think so!</p>\n</section><div><img
        src=\"https://dc8hdnsmzapvm.cloudfront.net/assets/images/guides/social_beginners/chapter_01/separator_snake_oil.png?52ca8a5\"></div>\n<section><h2>Is
        social media just a fad?</h2>\n<p>Over the last several years, there has been
        an explosion of growth in popular social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter,
        Google+, LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest, and many others. It''s safe to say
        that the era of social media is just getting started, and the need for social
        media in business will only become stronger over time. The whole world has
        seen the impact of the expansion and adoption of social media tactics, and
        the rising stats speak for themselves.</p>\n<em>Looking for sources? Click
        on any of the stats above!</em></section><div><img src=\"https://dc8hdnsmzapvm.cloudfront.net/assets/images/guides/social_beginners/chapter_01/separator_arrow.png?9bb223b\"></div>\n<section><div>\n<h2>Why
        does my company need social media?</h2>\n<p>Whether you are running a small,
        local operation, or heading a global, enterprise-level effort, the statistics
        above make it clear: Your customers are online. They are interacting in social
        channels with their friends, colleagues, and other brands in search of information,
        recommendations, and entertainment. If your company is not around to answer,
        a competitor will be. In doing so, your competitor will quite likely take
        away the customer at hand, along with anyone else listening.</p> \n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>There
        are tons of opportunities to add value-even to delight!-and making that connection
        can help build a person''s relationship with a company, brand, or representative.
        Those relationships create the foundation for what can eventually become one
        of your greatest marketing assets: customer advocacy.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Because
        so much of the customer experience now lives on the web, social media enables
        brands to take part in a customer''s online experience outside of the typical
        channels.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div><img src=\"https://dc8hdnsmzapvm.cloudfront.net/assets/images/guides/social_beginners/chapter_01/why_does.png?fa3c824\"><p>If
        you ever find yourself in a bind, your advocates will help remind the rest
        of the world who they''re rooting for. Advocacy is not something that you
        can stumble upon or buy. Advocacy is earned over time through continuous and
        positive engagement with your customer base. It is earned through experiences
        that delight, and through the delivery of the highest class of customer service.</p>
        \n</div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Advocacy is the nirvana of social media</strong>,
        and it is through advocacy that your efforts start to truly scale and grow.
        It shows that your brand is doing such an amazing job that your customers
        shout about your brand from rooftops, sharing their opinions and experiences
        with their networks. That sharing is the best marketing a brand can ask for.</p>\n<p>Identifying
        potential advocates is a good first step. You can use social tools (many of
        which are outlined in the rest of this guide), site data, customer data, and
        even your own observations to help you pick out which customers are likely
        to go to bat for your brand. You''ll want to figure out what is most important
        to those potential advocates. What are they looking for? Are they fishing
        for recognition? Are they excited by exclusive access to news and/or content?
        Figure out what type of advocates your brand attracts and find ways to recognize
        them for their advocacy. It is important to note, though, that most of your
        greatest community relationships will be built organically. While your research
        and brand knowledge encourages people and helps you put the right foot forward,
        relationships take time.</p>\n<img src=\"https://dc8hdnsmzapvm.cloudfront.net/assets/images/guides/social_beginners/chapter_01/advocacy.png?d60bde1\"><p>The
        transition from a passive web to an interactive web has brought with it many
        changes affecting how individuals connect with one another and also how businesses
        operate. At this stage in the game, it''s fair to say that a web presence
        is critical to the success of a business. You can''t get ahead if you''re
        ignoring your customer''s online conversations or opting to look the other
        way. Use this opportunity to get closer to your audience than ever before-reach
        more people in a genuine and authentic manner, drive more qualified site traffic,
        increase the authority of your brand, engage the people who influence your
        customers'' behavior, and gain the data necessary for insights-based business
        decisions.</p>\n<p>Maybe a better question is, why wouldn''t your company
        use social media?</p> \n</div>\n</section><div><img src=\"https://dc8hdnsmzapvm.cloudfront.net/assets/images/guides/social_beginners/chapter_01/separator_pool.png?e0f58ea\"></div>\n<section><h2>How
        can social be a springboard for success in other marketing channels?</h2>\n<p>Keep
        in mind that neither your customers'' experience nor your brand starts with
        Twitter, Facebook, or your blog. Social media should take your existing brand
        and solidify it, galvanize it, and bolster it. Your efforts in social media
        should be an extension of everything else you do in all departments of your
        company. Capturing your company''s voice and sharing it with the world through
        social media will open up unique opportunities in all other channels of inbound
        marketing, including SEO, branding, public relations, sales, and more.</p>\n<img
        src=\"https://dc8hdnsmzapvm.cloudfront.net/assets/images/guides/social_beginners/chapter_01/relationships.png?9291b9e\"><p>Relationships</p>\n<p>To
        get the most out of social media, make the relationships you build with it
        your end goal. That might sound a bit utopian for anyone who is grounded in
        more traditional and tangible business measurement and metrics, but take a
        step back from the bottom-line, ROI-seeking aspect to look at the big picture
        for a minute. The relationships built with customers are the foundations upon
        which other aspects of your business can and will flourish.</p>\n<p>Relationships
        flourish when you cultivate them, and no other area offers you the opportunity
        to do this as well as social media. Social channels have broken down the walls
        between individuals at an unprecedented rate. In 2011, Facebook released data
        showing that its users were, on average, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15844230\">3.74
        degrees of separation</a> away from one another, making them nearly as connected
        to each other as <a href=\"http://oracleofbacon.org/center.php\">Kevin Bacon
        is to the rest of Hollywood</a>. In the years since that study, the network
        has only continued to grow. That''s pretty amazing, and social media can take
        credit for making it happen.</p>\n<p>Some of the most successful SEOs and
        public relations professionals earn their notoriety, at least in part, from
        the relationships they are able to build. They''re also good at what they
        do, of course, but great relationships bolster their already solid effort.
        The relationships you build with your customers lead to advocacy and loyalty,
        traits that can support your brand during both the good and the bad times,
        representing an investment that will remain strong on nearly any platform
        and under nearly any circumstances.</p>\n<img src=\"https://dc8hdnsmzapvm.cloudfront.net/assets/images/guides/social_beginners/chapter_01/feedback.png?4aeac77\"><p>Feedback</p>\n<p>Information
        can be shared through social media at an amazingly fast pace, and users are
        increasingly turning to social channels to share information in real-time.
        This information often takes the form of opinions, so if you''re listening
        for the right cues from your audience, social media can become an invaluable
        source of insights and feedback. Incorporating social listening into product
        development work can act as an early warning system, save on customer service
        costs, provide valuable development feedback, and even help identify ideal
        beta testers without much expense.</p>\n<img src=\"https://dc8hdnsmzapvm.cloudfront.net/assets/images/guides/social_beginners/chapter_01/integration.png?725dd3b\"><p>Integration</p>\n<p>Social
        media is not something you can simply \"tack on\" to the rest of your marketing,
        branding, PR, and advertising efforts; it needs to be a fully integrated part
        of the mix. In doing so, you can create a cohesive and scalable experience
        for your customers. Think of it as a means to an end, and not an end in itself.
        Also, it''s not as hard as it sounds.</p>\n<p>Be sure to integrate social
        media into your marketing efforts as early as possible to help amplify and
        solidify your work rather than waiting until the end of a planning cycle to
        explore social options. If a social presence is clear from the start, your
        branding will benefit from additional customer touchpoints, PR will see a
        lift in impressions and reach, and customer service can proactively listen
        and activate where necessary.</p>\n<p>As you can see, a social presence can
        have far-reaching impact for your organization when it is executed in an authentic
        and thoughtful manner. By making social engagement a core part of your operations
        rather than an afterthought, you have a better shot at fully leveraging its
        power.</p>\n</section><div><img src=\"https://dc8hdnsmzapvm.cloudfront.net/assets/images/guides/social_beginners/chapter_01/separator_globe.png?edf851e\"></div>\n<section><p>How
        much of this guide do I need to read?</p>\n<p>As you can probably already
        tell, there''s more to social media than often meets the eye. While this guide
        is designed to be helpful no matter how much you read, we really recommend
        going cover to cover. Although every section might not apply to your social
        campaigns now, you''ll gain a deep understanding of the moving parts you might
        want to implement later, and you will be well-poised to create the most effective
        strategy you can.</p>\n<p>If you''d rather print it out and take it with you,

        href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/social-media-marketing\">ocial media
        marketing</a> can help elevate your audience and customer base in a dramatic
        way. But getting started without any previous experience or insight could
        be challenging.</p>\n<p>It''s vital that you understand social media marketing
        fundamentals. From maximizing quality to increasing your online entry points,
        abiding by these 10 laws will help build a foundation that will serve your
        customers, your brand and -- perhaps most importantly -- your bottom line.</p>\n<p><strong>1.
        The Law of Listening</strong><br>Success with social media and content marketing
        requires more listening and less talking. Read your target audience''s online
        content and join discussions to learn what''s important to them. Only then
        can you create content and spark conversations that add value rather than
        clutter to their lives.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The Law of Focus</strong><br>It''s
        better to specialize than to be a jack-of-all-trades. A highly-focused social
        media and content marketing strategy intended to build a strong brand has
        a better chance for success than a broad strategy that attempts to be all
        things to all people.</p>\n<p><strong>3. The Law of Quality</strong><br>Quality
        trumps quantity. It''s better to have 1,000 online connections who read, share
        and talk about your content with their own audiences than 10,000 connections
        who disappear after connecting with you the first time.</p>\n<p><strong>4.
        The Law of Patience</strong><br>Social media and content marketing success
        doesn''t happen overnight. While it''s possible to catch lightning in a bottle,
        it''s far more likely that you''ll need to commit to the long haul to achieve
        results.</p>\n<p><strong>5. The Law of Compounding</strong><br>If you publish
        amazing, quality content and work to build your online audience of quality
        followers, they''ll share it with their own audiences on Twitter, Facebook,
        LinkedIn, their own blogs and more.</p>\n<p>This sharing and discussing of
        your content opens new entry points for search engines like Google to find
        it in keyword searches. Those entry points could grow to hundreds or thousands
        of more potential ways for people to find you online.</p>\n<p><strong>6. The
        Law of Influence</strong><br>Spend time finding the online influencers in
        your market who have quality audiences and are likely to be interested in
        your products, services and business. Connect with those people and work to
        build relationships with them.</p>\n<p>If you get on their radar as an authoritative,
        interesting source of useful information, they might share your content with
        their own followers, which could put you and your business in front of a huge
        new audience.</p>\n<p><strong>7. The Law of Value</strong><br>If you spend
        all your time on the social Web directly promoting your products and services,
        people will stop listening. You must add value to the conversation. Focus
        less on conversions and more on creating amazing content and developing relationships
        with online influencers. In time, those people will become a powerful catalyst
        for word-of-mouth <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/marketing/\">marketing</a>
        for your business.</p>\n<p><strong>8. The Law of Acknowledgment</strong><br>You
        wouldn''t ignore someone who reaches out to you in person so don''t ignore
        them online. Building relationships is one of the most important parts of
        social media marketing success, so always acknowledge every person who reaches
        out to you.</p>\n<p><strong>9. The Law of Accessibility</strong><br>Don''t
        publish your content and then disappear. Be available to your audience. That
        means you need to consistently publish content and participate in conversations.
        Followers online can be fickle and they won''t hesitate to replace you if
        you disappear for weeks or months.</p>\n<p><strong>10. The Law of Reciprocity</strong><br>You
        can''t expect others to share your content and talk about you if you don''t
        do the same for them. So, a portion of the time you spend on social media
        should be focused on sharing and talking about content published by others.  </p>\n</div>",

        media efforts, contests, and events.    </li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Links </strong>-
        While using social media for marketing relies primarily on your business sharing
        its own unique, original content to gain followers, fans, and devotees, it''s
        also great to link to outside articles as well. If other sources provide great,
        valuable information you think your target audience will enjoy, don''t be
        shy about linking to them. Linking to outside sources improves trust and reliability,
        and you may even <a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/02/24/link-building-strategies\">get
        some links</a> in return.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Track Competitors </strong>-
        It''s always important to keep an eye on competitors-they can provide valuable
        data for keyword research, where to <a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/04/01/build-amazing-backlinks\">get
        industry-related links</a>, and other social media marketing insight. If your
        competitors are using a certain social media marketing technique that seems
        to be working for them, do the same thing, but do it better!</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Measure
        Success with Analytics </strong>-You can''t determine the success of your
        social media marketing strategies without tracking data. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/\">Google
        Analytics</a> can be used as a great social media marketing tool that will
        help you measure your triumphant <strong>social media marketing techniques</strong>,
        as well as determine which strategies are better off abandoned.  Attach tracking
        tags to your social media marketing campaigns so that you can properly monitor
        them.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>How to Use Social Media for Marketing: Know Your
        Platform</strong></h2>\n<p>We''ve put together a brief overview on <strong>how
        to use social media for marketing</strong> according to each platform''s unique
        environment. Various social media marketing sites will require different techniques,
        so develop a unique strategy tailored for each platform.</p>\n<strong>Facebook</strong><img
        src=\"http://www.wordstream.com/images/social-media-in-marketing.png\"><p>Facebook''s
        casual, friendly environment requires an active <strong>social media marketing
        strategy</strong> that begins with creating a Facebook Business Fan Page.  You
        will want to pay careful attention to layout, as the visual component is a
        key aspect of the Facebook experience. Social media marketing for business
        pages revolves around furthering your conversation with audiences by posting
        industry-related articles, images, videos, etc.</p>\n<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/\"><img

        to relax and chat with friends, so keep your tone light and friendly.</p>\n<p><a

        of Google+ circles, which allow you to segment your followers into smaller
        groups, enabling you to share information with some followers while barring
        others. For example, you might try creating a \"super-fan\" circle, and share
        special discounts and exclusive offers only with that group.</p>\n<strong>Pinterest</strong>
        <p>You can also try hosting video conferences with Hangouts and experiment
        using the Hangout feature in some fun, creative ways. Some social media marketing
        ideas: if you''re a salon, host a how-to session on how to braid your hair.
        If you own a local bookstore, try offering author video chats. If you''re
        feeling adventerous, invite your +1s to your Google+ Community. Google+ Communities
        will allow you to listen into your fan''s feedback and input, truly putting
        the social back into social media.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://pinterest.com/\">Pinterest</a>

        href=\"https://twitter.com/\">Twitter</a> is the <a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/10/21/social-media-promotion-tools\">social

        when possible.  Using Twitter as a social media marketing tool revolves around
        dialog and communication, so be sure to interact as much as possible</p>\n<p><a

        Social Media Tools</strong> <img src=\"http://www.wordstream.com/images/using-social-media-for-marketing.jpg\"><p><a
        href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\">YouTube</a> is the number one place for creating
        video content, with can be an incredibly powerful social media marketing tool.
        Many businesses try to create video content with the aim of having their video
        \"go viral,\" but in reality those chances are pretty slim. Instead, focus
        on creating useful, instructive \"how-to\" videos. These how-to videos also
        have the added benefit of ranking on the video search results of Google, so
        don''t under-estimate the power of video content!</p>\n<strong>Reddit</strong>
        <p>Social media platforms like <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com\">Yelp</a>, <a
        href=\"https://foursquare.com/\">FourSquare</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.thelevelup.com/\">Level
        Up</a> are great for brick and mortar businesses looking to implement marketing
        social media. Register on these sites to claim your location spot, and then
        consider extra incentives such as check-in rewards or special discounts. Remember,
        these visitors will have their phones in hand so they will have access to
        providing reviews which could hurt or significantly aid your users.</p>\n<p><a
        href=\"http://www.reddit.com/\">Reddit</a>, or similar social media platforms
        such as Stumble Upon or Digg, are ideal for sharing compelling content. With
        over 2 billion page views a month, Reddit has incredible social media marketing
        potential, but marketers should be warned that only truly unique, interesting
        content will be welcomed. Posting on Reddit is playing with fire-submit spammy
        or overtly sales-focused content and your business could get berated by this
        extremely tech-savvy community.</p>\n<p>If you have content you believe the
        Reddit community (majority is young, geeky, liberal, and internet-obsessed)
        would enjoy, you could reap tremendous benefits and earn valuable traffic.</p>\n<p><strong>Using
        social media in marketing</strong> does more than improve site traffic and
        help businesses reach more customers; it provides a valuable venue for better
        understanding and learning from your target audiences. Hopefully this guide

        Is Social Media Marketing?</h2>\n<p>Social media marketing refers to the process
        of gaining traffic or attention through social media sites.</p>\n<p>Social
        media itself is a catch-all term for sites that may provide radically different
        social actions. For instance, Twitter is a social site designed to let people
        share short messages or \"updates\" with others. Facebook, in contrast is
        a full-blown social networking site that allows for sharing updates, photos,
        joining events and a variety of other activities.</p>\n<h2>How Are Search
        &amp; Social Media Marketing Related?</h2>\n<p>Why would a search marketer
        - or a site about search engines - care about social media? The two are very
        closely related.</p>\n<p>Social media often feeds into the discovery of new
        content such as news stories, and \"discovery\" is a search activity. Social
        media can also help build links that in turn support into <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-seo\">SEO</a>
        efforts. Many people also perform searches at social media sites to find social
        media content. Social connections may also impact the relevancy of some search
        results, either within a social media network or at a ''mainstream'' search
        engine.</p>\n<h2>Social Media Marketing At Marketing Land</h2>\n<p>Marketing

        <p>When I went rock climbing for the first time, I had no idea what I was
        doing. My friends and I were complete newbies about ropes and rappelling and
        every other bit of jargon and technique that goes with climbing. We saw others
        doing it spectacularly well. We were thrilled at the thought of reaching the
        top of the climbing wall; we had no idea how to get there.</p>\n<p>I''d imagine
        that a social media marketing plan could feel the same way.</p>\n<p>If you''re
        starting from square one, it might feel equal parts thrilling and overwhelming.
        You know what you want to do and why. You can see that others have climbed
        the social media mountain; you''ve got few ideas how to get there yourself.</p>\n<p>It''d
        help to have a plan.</p>\n<p>We''ve shared before about different parts of
        a social media marketing plan- <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-stats-you-need-to-know\">the
        data and research</a> and personal experience behind <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-automation-guide\">what
        works on social media</a>. Now we''re pleased to put it all into a cohesive,
        step-by-step blueprint that you can use to get started. If you need a social
        media marketing plan, start here.</p>\n<p>Oh, and our friends at  <a href=\"http://www.venngage.com/\">online
        infographic maker Venngage</a>  were kind enough to wrap all that follows
        into a <a href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan\">comprehensive
        infographic</a> that''s easy to keep, share and reference:</p>\n<h2><strong>Social
        Media Marketing Plan</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting at the ground flour and building
        up, here is our overview of how to create a social media marketing plan from
        scratch.</p>\n<p>I like to think of this plan like a roadtrip. Start out by
        pointing yourself in the right direction, then choose the way you''re going
        to get there, check in regularly to make sure you''re on track, and have some
        fun along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose your social networks</p>\n<p><strong>Step
        2:</strong> Fill out your profiles completely</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>
        Find your voice and tone</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick your posting
        strategy</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Analyze and test</p>\n<p><strong>Step
        6:</strong> Automate and engage</p>\n<h2><strong>Step 1: Which social media
        sites you should use</strong></h2>\n<a href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan-update\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/choose-networks.png\"></a>
        <p>Social media is as homogenous from network to network as soda pop is from
        brand to brand. Sure, it''s all social media, but <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/advice-on-growing-a-google-page\">Google+</a>
        and <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/twitter-tips-for-beginners\">Twitter</a>
        might as well be Mountain Dew and Pepsi. Each network is unique, with its
        own best practices, own style, and own audience.</p>\n<p>You should choose
        the social networks that best fit your strategy and <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/goal-setting-strategies\">the
        goals you want to achieve</a> on social media.</p>\n<strong>You don''t have
        to be on them all-just the ones that matter to you and your audience.</strong>
        <p>Some things to consider that can help you choose not only <em>which</em>
        social networks to try but also <em>how many</em> to try.</p>\n<p><strong>Time
        - </strong>How much time can you devote to a social network? Plan on at least
        an hour per day per social network, at least at the start. (Once you get going,
        tools like <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer</a> can help you save a
        bit of time.)</p>\n<p><strong>Resources </strong>- What personnel and skills
        do you have to work with? Visual social networks like <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/pinterest-marketing-tips\">Pinterest
        </a>and <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/instagram-growth\">Instagram</a>
        require <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/14-tools-to-make-engaging-images-for-your-social-media-posts\">images
        and photos</a>. Social networks like Google+ emphasize quality content. Do
        you have the resources to create what''s needed?</p>\n<p><strong>Audience</strong>
        - Where do your <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/find-audience-build-a-community\">potential
        customers hang out</a>? Which social network has the right demographics?</p>\n<p>For
        the latter part of this decision, you can reference the audience research
        and demographics from surveys like those conducted by Pew Research. For instance,
        Pew has complete data, collected last fall, of the <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/09/demographics-of-key-social-networking-platforms-2/\">demographics
        for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn</a>. Here is a side-by-side
        comparison of Facebook and Twitter demographics.</p>\n<h2>\n<a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/09/demographics-of-key-social-networking-platforms-2/\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Facebook-and-Twitter-demographics.png\"></a><strong>Step
        2: Fill out your profiles completely</strong>\n</h2>\n<p>One of our monthly
        checks here at Buffer is to visit each of our social media profiles and make
        sure that our avatars, cover photos, <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-to-write-a-professional-bio-for\">bio</a>,
        and profile info is up-to-date and complete. It''s a key part to our <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-audit\">social
        media audit</a>. A completed profile shows professionalism, cohesive branding,
        and a signal to visitors that you''re serious about engaging.</p>\n<p>Profiles
        will require two parts: visuals and text.</p>\n<p>For visuals, we aim for
        consistency and familiarity with <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/a-complete-guide-to-creating-awesome-visual-content\">the
        visuals we use on social media</a>. Our avatar on Twitter matches our avatar
        on Facebook. Our cover photo on Google+ is similar to our cover on LinkedIn.</p>\n<a
        href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan-update\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/visuals.png\"></a>
        <p>To create these images, you can consult a <a href=\"http://www.rakacreative.com/blog/post/social-media-image-sizes-always-up-to-date\">social
        media image size chart</a> that will show you the exact breakdown of dimensions
        for each photo on each network. For an even easier time of it, you can use
        a tool like <a href=\"http://canva.com\">Canva</a>, which comes with prebuilt
        templates that set the proper sizes for you.</p>\n<a href=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-15-at-4.27.22-PM.png\"><img

        <p>For text, your main area to customize is the bio/info section.  <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/how-to-write-a-professional-bio-for\">Creating
        a professional social media bio</a> can be broken down into six simple rules.</p>\n<p>\n</p><ol><li>Show,
        don''t tell: \"What have I done\" often works better than \"Who I am\"</li>\n\t<li>Tailor
        your keywords to your audience</li>\n\t<li>Keep language fresh; avoid buzzwords</li>\n\t<li>Answer
        the question of your potential followers: \"What''s in it for me?\"</li>\n\t<li>Be
        personal and personable</li>\n\t<li>Revisit often</li>\n</ol><h2><strong>Step
        3: Find your marketing voice and tone</strong></h2>\n<a href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan-update\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/voice-and-tone.png\"></a>
        <p>The temptation at this point might be to jump right in and start sharing.
        Just one more step before you do. <strong>Your foray into social media will
        be more focused and more on point if you come up with <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-marketing-voice-and-tone\">a
        voice and tone for your content</a></strong> right off the bat.</p>\n<p>To
        do so, you could spend time coming up with <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/marketing-personas-beginners-guide\">marketing
        personas</a> and debating the finer points of your mission statement and customer
        base. These are all well and good. However, for a social media marketing plan
        just getting off the ground, you can make this process a bit easier. <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-marketing-voice-and-tone\">Start
        with questions like these</a>:</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul><li>If your brand was a person,
        what kind of personality would it have?</li>\n\t<li>If your brand was a person,
        what''s their relationship to the consumer? (a coach, friend, teacher, dad,
        etc)</li>\n\t<li>Describe in adjectives what your company''s personality is
        not.</li>\n\t<li>Are there any companies that have a similar personality to
        yours? Why are they similar?</li>\n\t<li>How do you want your customers to
        think about your company?</li>\n</ul><p>At the end of this exercise, you should
        end up with a handful of adjectives that describe the voice and tone of your
        marketing. Consider this to keep you on track: Voice is the mission statement;
        tone is the implementation of that mission.</p>\n<p>MailChimp has created
        <a href=\"http://voiceandtone.com/\">a standalone website simply for its voice
        and tone</a>. Here''s an example of how they implement these qualities into
        their communication:</p>\n<img src=\"http://bufferblog.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2014-04-12-at-1.26.37-PM.png\"><p><strong>Cultivate
        a voice that delights your customers</strong>, then your customers will be
        thrilled to spread the love about you.</p>\n<h2><strong>Step 4: Pick your
        posting strategy</strong></h2>\n<p>What''s the ideal amount to post per day?
        How <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-often-post-social-media\">often
        should you post</a>? When should you post? What should you post? The solid
        gold, ironclad answer on questions like these is:</p>\n<p>It depends.</p>\n<p>So
        much of the social media experience is about your individual audience and
        niche. What works for you might not work for me, and you never know until
        you try (we''ll get to trying in step five).</p>\n<p>That being said, there
        is some pretty good data and insight about where to start. Here''s what we''ve
        found to be good jumping off points.</p>\n<a href=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Social-Media-Posting-Strategy.png\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Social-Media-Posting-Strategy.png\"></a>
        <h3><strong>What should you be posting?</strong></h3>\n<strong>Images are
        ideal.</strong> <p>The push toward <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/a-complete-guide-to-creating-awesome-visual-content\">visual
        content</a> has plenty of anecdotal evidence-as you browse the streams on
        Twitter and Facebook, you''re likely to see images all over. There''s data
        to back up this change: Image posts get more views, clicks, reshares, and
        likes than any other type of post. And it''s not even close.</p>\n<p>On Facebook,  <a
        href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/7-facebook-stats-you-should-know-for-a-more-engaging-page\">photos
        get 53% more likes, 104% more comments and 84% more click-throughs on links</a>
        than text-based posts.</p>\n<p>Same goes for Twitter. In a study of over two
        million tweets from verified users across a number of different industries,
        Twitter found that <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/2014/what-fuels-a-tweets-engagement\">photos
        have the greatest effect on retweets</a>.</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul><li>\n<strong>Photos</strong>
        average a 35% boost in Retweets</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Videos</strong> get
        a 28% boost</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Quotes</strong> get a 19% boost in Retweets</li>\n\t<li>Including
        a <strong>number</strong> receives a 17% bump in Retweets</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Hashtags</strong>
        receive a 16% boost</li>\n</ul><a href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan-update\"><img

        <h3>The 4:1 Strategy</h3>\n<p>Now that you know what works, you can place
        these different types of updates into a consistent strategy. One of my favorite
        systems is the one <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/the-5-types-of-tweets-to-keep-your-buffer-full-and-your-followers-engaged\">used
        by Buffer''s co-founder Joel Gascoigne</a>. It works like this:</p>\n<p>\n</p><ol><li>Start
        with <strong>the basic five types of updates</strong> we all post: Links,
        images, quotes, reshares, plain-text updates</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Choose
        a \"staple\" update</strong>, a single type that will make up the majority
        of your shares</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Create a 4:1 ratio of sharing</strong>:
        for every four \"staple\" updates, publish one different type for variety</li>\n</ol><a
        href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan-update\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4-1-system.png\"></a>
        <p>This way your followers know what to expect from you, and you can hone
        your sharing to a specific type, making it easier to perfect and to experiment.</p>\n<p>(Note:
        You might won''t want to post the exact same updates across each of your social
        networks. Consider composing your updates in a unique way to complement each
        network''s own best practices, culture, and language.)</p>\n<h3><strong>How
        often should you be posting?</strong></h3>\n<p>There''s been a lot of interesting
        data out there about <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-often-post-social-media\">how
        often to post to social media</a>. Some of the factors that might impact your
        specific sharing frequency may include your industry, your reach, your resources,
        and the quality of your updates. The social network you''re using will have
        its own best practices, too.</p>\n<strong>If people love your updates, you
        can typically always get away with posting more.</strong> <p>For a specific
        number, here''re some guidelines we''ve put together based on some really
        helpful <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-frequency-guide\">research
        into how often to post to social media</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan-update\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/how-often.png\"></a>
        <h3><strong>When should you be posting?</strong></h3>\n<p>There are many neat
        tools to show you <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/best-time-to-tweet-post-to-facebook-send-emails-publish-blogposts\">the
        best time of day to post to Facebook, Twitter, and more</a>. These <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/best-social-media-tools-for-small-business\">tools</a>
        look at your followers and your history of posts to see when your audience
        is online and when historically have been your best times to share.</p>\n<p>So
        what''s someone to do who''s just starting out on these social networks, with
        no audience and no history?</p>\n<p>Again, this is where best practices come
        in. Perhaps the most helpful (and adorable) infographic I''ve seen about timing
        comes from SumAll, which <a href=\"http://blog.sumall.com/journal/timing-everything-post-smarter-meow.html\">compiled
        timing research</a> from sites like Visual.ly, Search Engine Watch, and Social
        Media Today to create its awesome visual. Here''s an overview of what they
        found in terms of timing (all times are Eastern Time).</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul><li>\n<strong>Twitter</strong>
        - 1-3pm weekdays</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Facebook</strong> - 1-4pm and 2-5pm
        weekdays</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>LinkedIn</strong> - 7-8:30am and 5-6pm Tuesday,
        Wednesday, and Thursday</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Tumblr</strong> - 7-10pm weekdays
        and 4pm on Fridays</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Instagram</strong> - 5-6pm weekdays
        and 8pm on Mondays with a sweetspot at 6pm</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Pinterest</strong>
        - 2-4pm and 8-11pm weekdays with weekends being the best</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Google+</strong>
        - 9-11am weekdays</li>\n</ul><a href=\"https://infograph.venngage.com/p/38582/social-media-marketing-plan-update\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/optimal-times.png\"></a>
        <h2><strong>Step 5: Analyze, test, and iterate</strong></h2>\n<p>Remember
        how we talked about social media sharing being a very individual, specific
        endeavor? Your stats will likely start to bear this out.</p>\n<strong>The
        more you post, the more you''ll discover which content, timing, and frequency
        is right for you.</strong> <p>How will you know? It''s best to get <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/time-saving-social-media-tools\">a
        reporting tool</a>. Most major social networks will have basic analytics built
        into the site; it''s just a little easier to seek and find this information
        from an all-encompassing dashboard.</p>\n<p>These tools (I''ll use <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer''s
        analytics</a> as an example) can show you a breakdown of how each post performed
        in the important areas of views, clicks, shares, likes, and comments.</p>\n<a
        href=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-15-at-4.43.29-PM.png\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-15-at-4.43.29-PM.png\"></a>
        <p><a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/definitive-guide-social-media-metrics-stats\">Which
        social media stats are best?</a> We''ve gained some insight from looking at
        each of these main statistics and the composite engagement stat on a per-post
        basis. The resulting stat gives us a great look, over time, of how our social
        media content tends to perform, and we can then test and iterate from there.</p>\n<p>Here''s
        one way this analysis step.</p>\n<p><strong>Set a benchmark</strong>. After
        two weeks or a month of sharing, you can go back through your stats and find
        the average number of clicks, shares, likes, and comments per post. This''ll
        be your benchmark going forward. You can come back and update this number
        at any time as your following and influence grows.</p>\n<p><strong>Test something
        new.</strong> We''re open to testing just about anything at Buffer. We''re
        in the midst of some tests right now on our Twitter account. Do Twitter-optimized
        images gain more clicks than non-optimized images? Does capitalization matter?
        We''ll often hear about someone''s new strategy or get a new idea and then
        test right away.</p>\n<p><strong>Did it work?</strong> Check the stats from
        your test versus the stats of your benchmark. If your test performed well,
        then you can implement the changes into your regular strategy. And once your
        test is over, test something new!</p>\n<a href=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Add-text.png\"><img
        src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Add-text.png\"></a>
        <h2><strong>Step 6: Automate, engage, and listen</strong></h2>\n<p>The final
        piece of a social media marketing plan involves having a system you can follow
        to help you stay on top of updates and engaged with your community.</p>\n<p>To
        start with, automate your updates. Tools like <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer</a>
        allow you to create all the content and updates that you want to, all at once,
        and then place everything into a queue to be sent out according to whatever
        schedule you choose. <strong><a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-automation-guide\">Automation
        is the secret weapon</a> for consistently excellent sharing, day after day.</strong></p>\n<p>Your
        plan doesn''t end with automation, though. <strong>Social media requires engagement,
        too.</strong> When people talk to you, talk back. Set aside time during your
        day to followup with conversations that are happening on social media. These
        are conversations with potential customers, references, friends, and colleagues.
        They''re too important to ignore.</p>\n<p>One way to stay up on all the conversations
        that are happening around you and your company is to create a system for listening.
        Tools like <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/mention-and-buffer-partner-for-a-better-way-to-monitor-and-publish-on-social-media\">Mention</a>
        will send you an alert every time you''re mentioned online, and you can rely
        on custom searches and email alerts for mentions on specific networks, too.</p>\n<h2><strong>What
        would you share with someone new to social media?</strong></h2>\n<p>Coming
        up with a social media marketing plan is a great step toward diving in to
        social. If social media looks thrilling and overwhelming all at once, start
        with a plan. Once you see the blueprint in front of you, it''s a little easier
        to see what lies ahead.</p>\n<p>\n</p><ol><li>Pick your networks</li>\n\t<li>Fill
        out your info</li>\n\t<li>Find your voice</li>\n\t<li>Choose your strategy</li>\n\t<li>Analyze
        and test</li>\n\t<li>Automate and engage</li>\n</ol><p>Bingo!</p>\n<p>How
        did you develop your social media strategy? I''d love to keep the conversation
        going in the comments. If you know someone who could use this, feel free to
        pass this along. If you can use it yourself, let me know how it goes!<br><a

        Media Marketing Overview</h2>\n<p><strong>Facebook Page Management<br></strong>
        The goal of our Facebook management service is to increase the engagement
        rate with the existing base of Facebook fans. One of the ways that we accomplish
        this is through an ongoing content marketing system that runs through the
        website of the client. Our system publishes articles with infographics that
        have a proven track record of being shared within Facebook. This allows us
        to send high converting traffic to pages within your site that reinforce social
        media marketing via sharing.</p>\n<p><strong>Facebook Like Building</strong><br>
        We work with our clients to increase the total number of prospects and customers
        that have liked their Facebook page. Every social media marketing campaign
        is unique to each client, and we focus on leveraging existing assets that
        will deliver the highest ROI.<br><br><strong>Facebook Social Media Advertising</strong><br>
        We create and manage Facebook ad campaigns for our clients. Our social media
        ad experts create custom Facebook ad campaigns that are designed to focus
        in on the ideal target audience with the highest conversion rate. The design
        team also creates custom landing pages tailored to be congruent with each
        advertisement.<br><br><strong>Example of Good Placement of Facebook Share
        Button</strong><br> The blog <a href=\"http://www.wpvirtuoso.com/\">WPVirtuoso</a>
        does a really good job at placing its Facebook share buttons at the bottom
        of each post. They also place a nice call-to-action statement right in front
        of it that reads, \"Share this post now.\" Just by placing a few good words
        next to a like button can double the amount of likes a post will get.</p>\n\n<p><br></p><h2>Twitter
        Social Media Marketing Overview</h2>\n<p><strong>Twitter Account Management<br></strong>
        As with Facebook, we leverage our content marketing system to push targeted
        Twitter traffic back to the client''s website. The end goal is to drive more
        revenue from social media marketing. This is accomplished by creating tweets
        that having the highest click through and retweet rate. The two major components
        of a successful tweet are the message and the landing page.</p>\n<p><strong>Increasing
        Twitter Followers</strong><br> One of the primary goals of our social media
        marketing campaigns is to increase the total number of Twitter followers to
        our clients. The number of followers that a company has can influence everything
        from the conversions ratio of the site to how long a visitor will stay on
        a website. We use a variety of social media marketing techniques and strategies
        to increase this number.<br><br><strong>Twitter Social Media Advertising</strong><br>
        We use a network of the most influential users on Twitter to promote our clients
        to. The network is made up of over 42,000 people and businesses that have
        agreed to tweet out messages in exchange for getting paid for each click that
        the tweet generates. We also work with high profile celebrities that are paid
        per tweet as opposed to per click.<br><br><strong>Example of Good Placement
        of Twitter Tweet Button</strong><br> The Glow Day Spa blog does a great job
        of placing the tweet button on their <a href=\"http://www.glowdayspatampa.com/spablog/american-manicure-vs-french-manicure-which-to-get/\">articles</a>.
        They have a custom tweet button, along with their other social share buttons,
        right below the title of each of their posts. This is a great way of showing
        immediate exposure of the social share button while using the same color scheme
        of the blog.</p>\n\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 1, "name": "Facebook Social

        of your customers are using some form of social network. Facebook, Twitter,
        Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Google Plus networks are swarming with people trying
        to find the products and services they crave. Social media is changing the
        way that businesses initiate and maintain relationships with their clients.
        However, social networks are very sensitive, and your reputation is at stake.
        One wrong move, and you can destroy your image.</p>\n<p>Our team has the finesse
        and experience you need. Since every social network is different, we have
        thoroughly tested and proven specific methods for each. Our team has mastered
        social marketing on almost a dozen different platforms. Let us help you safely
        engage the users in your network. </p>\n<strong>Social Media is Measurable
        </strong> <p>No followers? No problem. We know all the tricks to create buzz,
        generate an explosion of fans and followers, and connect you with thousands
        of qualified customers. We build your online community, enhance and promote
        your brand, and generate new customers.</p>\n<p>We can prove it. Do not listen
        to anyone telling you that you can''t track and measure social media marketing
        initiatives. You absolutely can. We do it every day. Likes, shares, recommends,
        votes, plus ones, tweets, retweets, pins, and all other forms of engagement
        are measurable. </p>\n<p>Engagement is the currency of social media. No engagement,
        and you will not convert those users into customers. Interact with your followers
        in the right way, and you turn them into buyers. These interactions are crucial,
        because they define your brand''s personality and set the tone of what ''could
        be'' a lifetime relationship with a customer or client. We can help you with
        these interactions, and ensure they result in new business. </p>\n<p>We call
        this Social ROI - return on interaction. And yes, we actually track it.</p>\n<strong>Planning
        &amp; Strategy </strong> <p>We create a social media strategy custom tailored
        to meet your specific marketing needs. You will have a team of dedicated social
        media experts with a proven track record of creating dynamic online brands
        and generating new sales.</p>\n<strong>Implementation Guideline </strong>
        <p>Whether you''ve been given the task of utilizing a social media budget,
        or just need help formulating a strategy for your brand or project, we can
        help you create an appropriate strategy. Our professional and friendly staff
        will evaluate your needs, discover opportunity, then craft a detailed plan
        that when executed, leverages the power of social media and ensures your long
        term success</p>\n<strong>Software Recommendations </strong> <p>Did you already
        determine what you wish to do with social media, yet you require assistance
        in navigating a complicated and subjective landscape? We will work with you
        in order to assure your brand''s integrity, compliance with the various mediums,
        and help you execute according to the best practices for future communication
        and development.</p>\n<strong>Social Media Audit </strong> <p>Just like there
        are many search engine optimization tools, there are even more social media
        tools because of the bigger audience and burst of open source software technology.
        Locating tools to track opportunities, performance, management and more could
        be daunting. We may make recommendations based upon the nature of your brand''s
        initiatives, the social environments you participate in, and your budget.</p>\n<strong>Competitive
        Analysis </strong> <p>We provide a detailed analysis of your website or brand
        presence across the different social networks, and plan a multitude of methods
        for improving it. Not every website has a presence on MySpace or Digg, therefore
        we customize our analysis around relevant mainstream tactics and niche opportunities.</p>\n<strong>Social
        Profile Development </strong> <p>Is the competition doing a great job with
        blogs, videos, widgets, linkbait, or community building? We will examine their
        tactics and prospective service providers, and establish action alerts which
        will provide you instant feedback to begin implementing to take control of
        your online space.</p>\n<strong>Facebook Marketing </strong> <p>Your business
        needs a professional and appropriate presence in particular social networks.
        We will identify the vital communities you need to be participating in, and
        determine where individuals are chatting about you. Additionally, we assist
        you in creating and managing your own social media profiles in order to attract
        traffic and leverage the 2-way conversation. </p>\n<strong>Twitter Marketing
        </strong> <p>We offer many ways to help build and engage your community on
        Facebook. We begin by creating a Facebook Page (business profile) that helps
        to attract fans, create polls, post events and develop interactive applications
        to encourage fan participation. Then we create regular content to build your
        brand and convert fans into customers.</p>\n<strong>Google Plus Marketing
        </strong> <p>Twitter has changed the way that customers communicate with companies
        on the web. This micro blogging platform is a powerful way to promote new
        deals and events in real-time. We use it to post product updates, to update
        clients on current information, or simply to make suggestions and share information
        of interest with followers. Our Twitter marketing program builds your follower
        base, engages with clients and prospects, and promotes your brand online.</p>\n<strong>LinkedIn
        Marketing </strong> <p>Since its launch in June 2011, Google+ has already
        become the fastest growing social network in modern history. Google+ is more
        than another social network. It is the bridge between search and social media.
        It will change how people find your business. That''s why Orange County SEO
        has launched the first and only program of its kind - a monthly Google+ Marketing
        Program that builds on all the best SEO and social media strategies to help
        you create new leads.</p>\n<p>Did you know that 65% of companies have used
        LinkedIn to increase sales? That''s because LinkedIn is an amazing resource
        that lets you grow your network and establish yourself as an industry leader.</p>\n<strong>Pinterest
        Marketing </strong> <p>In business, relying on your social network is the
        smartest thing you can do when making a decision. When it comes to the Internet,
        business relationships still matter. We help you build your online presence
        in a real and trustworthy way. We help you create new business opportunities
        by proving you''re the industry expert. We use LinkedIn to help you interact
        with clients, drive traffic and create new business opportunities.</p>\n<p>Pinterest
        is not just another social network. It is an amazing new way to get your products
        found, shared and purchased on the web. Since its launch 2010, Pinterest has
        become one of the most powerful forces in viral marketing. Companies of all
        sizes are using Pinterest to reach a new audience, increase visits to their
        websites, and generate leads or retail sales.</p>\n<strong>Badge Creation
        &amp; Strategy </strong> <p>Our social marketing programs build on all the
        best social media strategies and platforms to connect with customers, drive
        traffic, and increase sales.</p>\n<p>Do you wish to spread happiness to your
        users by providing them something that is relevant or useful to them? We develop
        interactive badges which are going to position you as an authority within
        the field and possess obvious link-building advantages.</p>\n<p><strong>Widget
        Strategy Creation: </strong> We will examine your site and see if you''d benefit
        from any interactive widget campaign. It will include identifying which kind
        of widget might work for your website, and its possibility for success, and
        what the competition are (or aren''t) doing, as well as how you could improve
        upon that.</p>\n<p><strong>Blog Design, Optimization and/or Setup: </strong>
        Blogs set up incorrectly will not attract readers or bring you the search
        engine benefits you are after. We help you discover the ideal blogging platform
        for your requirements, assist you in optimizing your blog for success from
        the start, and show you how you can fix it to make it to make it more accessible
        to search engines and users alike.</p>\n<p><strong>Blog Strategy Creation:
        </strong> Let us help you develop a blog plan which carves a space for your
        personal or corporate brand in the greater blog atmosphere. It may involve
        crafting concepts for blog posts, writing these posts themselves, teaching
        you how you can comment on additional blogs to build up awareness, and a lot
        more.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Building Plan Creation: </strong> We will
        outline what communities are worth observing, what your competitors are doing,
        and how to naturally enter those communities and form relationships. This
        strategy will also teach you how you can identify the vital conversations
        within your field, and how, when, and to whom you can reach out to.</p>\n<p><strong>Community
        Observance: </strong> Do you not possess an in-house staff which you could
        allocate community building to? Nobody knows your industry and services better
        than you, yet if you want assistance, we can observe the communities that
        are important to you. We will track your competitors, your brand, your keywords,
        and anything else you hand us to monitor. Our team is traind to proactively

        firm has specialty! Ours is social media marketing (SMM). In fact, our CEO
        wrote the best-selling  <a href=\"http://www.shamakabani.com/books/\">book
        on social media marketing</a>, and  <a href=\"http://www.marketingzen.com/about-us/our-people/\">our
        staff</a> is made up of experienced experts with real-world experience in
        helping clients achieve their marketing communications goals.</p>\n<p>The
        Marketing Zen Group is a full-service agency - whatever our clients need online,
        we can provide. But our focus isn''t on selling services to clients - it''s
        on partnering with our clients to help them achieve their goals.  <strong>We
        offer turn-key social media marketing services to our clients including strategy,
        implementation, and training</strong>. We train our clients in using social
        media, help them to define their strategy and select tactics, and how to measure
        their SROI (social return on investment). There are a lot of agencies out
        there who will offer to help you design and implement a full-fledged SMM campaign
        - but we''re proud of being recognized as one of the few that actually becomes
        a strategic partner with our clients.</p>\n<h2>What is Social Media Marketing?</h2>\n<p>We''d
        define social media marketing this way: To increase sales by promoting a product
        or service via social media platforms like  <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</a>,  <a
        href=\"https://plus.google.com/\">Google+</a>,  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\">Twitter</a>,  <a
        href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a>,  <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/\">Pinterest</a>,  <a
        href=\"http://instagram.com/\">Instagram</a> and others, using a range of
        marketing communications tools and techniques.</p>\n<p>Let''s take a quick
        look at traditional marketing vs. social media marketing.</p>\n<p>Many of
        the tools used in traditional marketing -  <a href=\"http://www.marketingzen.com/services/ppc/\">advertising</a>,  <a
        href=\"http://www.marketingzen.com/services/digital-pr/\">public relations</a>,  <a
        href=\"http://www.marketingzen.com/services/content-marketing/\">content marketing</a>,
        contests and promotions - are also used in social media marketing. The difference
        is that social media marketing requires a change in focus and attitude that
        has proven very difficult for some agencies to learn. It''s why hiring an
        agency built from the ground up to maximize your social media results makes
        sense: we can guide you through the rapidly changing landscape, and help you
        avoid costly mistakes while you get the results you want.</p>\n<h2>Why Bother
        with Social Media Marketing?</h2>\n<p>Social media gives business owners powerful
        tools for reaching thousands of prospects and clients at the click of a mouse.
        However, you need a strong business strategy and knowledge of online marketing
        before these tools will deliver measurable return on investment.</p>\n<p>We
        build the metrics and measurement analytics in to our SMM campaigns from the
        beginning - so you''ll know how to measure the results you get before you
        spend a dollar on social media marketing. Collecting the right data, and analyzing
        it with a view towards long-term success, is just part of the strong business
        mind-set we bring to every client project.</p>\n<p>To that end, we''ll help
        you figure out:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul><li>What exactly am I trying to accomplish
        with social media and why?</li>\n\t<li>What are the most pressing challenges
        that prospective and current customers face, and how can I help them overcome
        these?</li>\n\t<li>What are the most effective delivery tools for my messages?</li>\n\t<li>How
        can I build enduring relationships and turn strangers into lifetime customers?</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<p>It
        all comes down to your overall plan. An effective social media strategy is
        all about the big picture. <em><strong>What</strong></em> needs to be accomplished,
        and <em><strong>why</strong></em>. Once the strategy is in place, we''ll help
        you move on to the tactics - the <em><strong>where</strong></em>, <em><strong>when</strong></em>,
        and <em><strong>how</strong></em> - that will implement your strategy.</p>\n<p>Your
        website is the most critical part of your social media strategy. If it isn''t
        ready to convert browsers into customers, with well-written, easy-to-navigate,
        attractive pages that are optimized so the search engines can help potential
        customers find you, then that should be addressed before you invest heavily
        in a social media campaign. (Got questions about what makes a website \"social
        media ready\"? Talk to one of our web experts today.)</p>\n<h2>Selecting Your
        Social Media Targets</h2>\n<p>Whether you''re active in social media or not,
        you already have a presence there. Customers, employees, suppliers, vendors,
        and even competitors are already talking about you on social media sites like
        Facebook, Yelp, Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Pinterest, YouTube, and Google+.</p>\n<p>Does
        your business need to be on all of these social media platforms? Maybe - maybe
        not. It depends on the demographics of your audience. One of the things that
        makes The Marketing Zen Group different from other agencies is that we don''t
        show up at the first meeting with a pre-packaged plan to sell to a new client.
        We''ll listen to you first, then and develop recommendations for your company
        that will help you achieve your specific goals, solve the most pressing problems,
        and stay within your budget. We don''t believe in one-size fits all social
        media marketing - and neither should you.</p>\n<p>In fact, 49% of web users
        will make a purchase this month based on recommendations they received through
        a social media site.</p>\n<p>Evaluate your Social Return on Investment (SROI).
        Evaluate SROI as a tool for measuring a much broader concept of value. SROI
        incorporates social, environmental, and economic costs and benefits into decision
        making and helps you readjust your strategy and tactics to meet your goals.</p>\n<h2>Measuring
        SROI</h2>\n<p>Counting the numbers is the easy part. Website visitors, blog
        links, Twitter mentions, Facebook fans and LinkedIn and Google+ connections
        are all numbers worth measuring.</p>\n<p>Numbers, however, tell only half
        of the story. There''s also the question of sentiment - what percentage of
        the comments about your brand are positive instead of negative? Is your social
        media marketing effort pushing that sentiment needle in a positive direction?</p>\n<p>Your
        SROI - social return on investment - has to go a step further, and connect
        the results to your bottom line. We''ve been helping companies do that for
        years, and we''d love the chance to show you how to do it, too.</p>\n<p>Analytics
        will tell you how many visitors came to your website from Facebook, Twitter,
        and LinkedIn. They will also reveal how many people are engaging, buying,
        and more. Using analytics to constantly adapt our strategies, we are able
        to deliver our clients the best bang for their buck.</p>\n<p>Ready to  <a

        What the heck is social media and what role does it play in my marketing?
        This is probably a question I wouldn''t have received two years ago, but yet
        today it''s the most common question that enters my inbox.\n<p>First off,
        let''s talk about what social media is. Social media represents low-cost tools
        that are used to combine technology and social interaction with the use of
        words. These tools are typically internet or mobile based.</p>\n<p> A few
        that you have probably heard of include Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and YouTube.</p>\n<p><a
        href=\"http://marketing.about.com/od/internetmarketingstrategy/a/socialmediamrkt.htm\">Social
        media</a> gives marketers a voice and a way to communicate with peers, customers
        and potential consumers. It personalizes the \"brand\" and helps you to spread
        your message in a relaxed and conversational way.</p>\n<p>The downfall to
        social media, if you could call it that is that it must be a part of your
        everyday life in order to keep the momentum and attention you need for it
        to be successful.</p>\n<p>If you think that social media is only for the <a
        href=\"http://sbinformation.about.com/od/marketingsales/tp/social-media-for-small-business.htm\">small
        business owners</a> that are trying out an experiment, I have to correct you.
        Here are just a few companies that have become involved in social media:</p>\n<p><b>Absolut
        Vodka</b> - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/absolutworld\">Online Video on
        YouTube</a> and <a href=\"http://marketing.about.com/od/internetmarketing/a/facebookmktg.htm\">Using
        Facebook</a> to house their <a href=\"http://www.new.facebook.com/pages/ABSOLUT-TOP-BARTENDER/17749437762\">Top
        Bartender</a> <a href=\"http://marketing.about.com/od/socialmediamarketing/a/facebookeventsetup.htm\">fan
        page</a>.</p>\n<p><b>BMW</b> - Utilizing Facebook to promote their <a href=\"http://www.new.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=11862454810\">1-Series
        Road Trip</a> and they have created a <a href=\"http://www.new.facebook.com/pages/The-Ramp/23771095713\">Rampenfest
        Page</a> for fans.</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http://retailindustry.about.com/od/retailbestpractices/ig/Company-Mission-Statements/Dunkin--Donuts-Mission-Statement.htm\">Dunkin
        Donuts</a></b> - That''s right they''ve found value in social media and have
        set up a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dunkindonuts\">microblogging</a> Twitter
        account.</p>\n<p><b>Barack Obama</b> - In my examples, I can''t leave out
        future <a href=\"http://webtrends.about.com/od/web20/a/obama-web.htm\">President
        Barack Obama</a>.</p>\n<p> He has been seen as a leader in the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/BarackObama\">use
        of Twitter during the Presidential Election</a>. He has over 170,000 followers
        and is following over 165,000. Personally I remember the \" <a href=\"http://marketing.about.com/od/internetmarketingstrategy/a/twitterbuzz.htm\">twitter
        buzz</a>\" during the Presidential Debates as well as the election.</p>\n<p>As
        you can see we have adult beverage companies, exotic automobile manufacturers,
        pastry shops and our future President using social media tool, it''s not to
        hard to figure out that there is something to it.</p>\n<p>What role should
        it play in your marketing? As most of you know my view of marketing is it''s
        a tool we use to inform consumers about our products, who we are and what
        we offer. Social media does that. Here is how:</p>\n<ul><li>We can use social
        media to provide an identity to who we are and the products or services that
        we offer. </li>\n\t<li>We can create relationships using social media with
        people who might not otherwise know about our products or service or what
        our companies represent. </li>\n\t<li>Social media makes us \"real\" to consumers.
        If you want people to follow you don''t just talk about the latest product
        news, but share your personality with them. </li>\n\t<li>We can use social
        media to associate ourselves with our peers, that may be serving the same
        target market. </li>\n\t<li>We can use social media to communicate and provide
        the interaction that consumers look for. </li>\n</ul><p>As you can see social
        media carries with it a lot of value, but how do you do it right?</p>\n<ul><li>You
        cannot just depend on social media, you must integrate it with other vehicles
        of marketing. While social media will create awareness, I''m not convinced
        that in the beginning it will sell a million dollars worth of product. That''s
        not to say that one day once you''ve built up your social media \"stardom\"
        that it won''t, but it probably won''t happen tomorrow.</li>\n\t<li>Be yourself,
        reflect personality. There are no written \"right\" or \"wrong\" rules when
        it comes to social media, only you can determine what will work for you.</li>\n\t<li>Be
        consistent, if you do not plan on being consistent don''t do it at all - it''s
        a waste of everyone''s time. </li>\n</ul><p>Success stories are abundant when
        it comes using social media from headhunters that find job applicants to new
        businesses that want to introduce a new product as well as already established
        <a href=\"http://beginnersinvest.about.com/od/investingglossary/g/fortune-500.htm\">Fortune
        500</a> companies that want to strengthen their brand. The role of social
        media in your marketing is to use it as a communication tool that makes you
        accessible to those interested in your product and makes you visible to those
        that don''t know your product. Use it as a tool that creates a personality
        behind your brand and creates relationships that you otherwise may never gain.
        This creates not only repeat-buyers, but <a href=\"http://sbinformation.about.com/od/advertisingpr/a/customerloyalty.htm\">customer
        loyalty</a>. Fact is social media is so diversified that it can be used in
        whatever way best suits the interest and the needs of your business.</p>\n</div>",

        content lands on social media every second that a person can''t possibly catch
        it all. (pokemon)</p>\n<p>At Buffer, we reach 5% of our followers with a tweet

        times in order to reach those who missed it the first time!</em><p>Change
        up your message: alternate the headline, grab a pullquote, share an image,
        etc. so that you have something new to share (and can learn what resonates
        most by checking analytics after).</p>\n<p>Here''s how:</p>\n<p>Come up with
        some sort of sharing schedule. Here''s <a href=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/8109206415f7c9e3b2ddc83ad/images/66374e44-d99e-4667-b80c-1b259e03bf9e.png\">ours</a>

        Wisemetrics study</a> found that, on average, the second tweet gets 86% as
        much performance as the first one, and even after 6 repetitions, you''re still
        at 67% of the first tweet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And here''s the video we''ve

        that might be helpful for you and your marketing efforts.</p>\n<strong>What
        happens at the end of the 25 days?</strong> <p>Everyone! It''s not tied to
        Buffer accounts at all, so both current Buffer users and yet-to-be Buffer
